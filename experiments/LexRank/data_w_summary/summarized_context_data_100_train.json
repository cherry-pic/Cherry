REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, which has been seeking President Donald Trump\u2019s tax records, subpoenaed his longtime lender Deutsche Bank last year, suggesting its criminal investigation into Trump\u2019s business practices is more wide-ranging than previously known, the New York Times said on Wednesday. The prosecutors issued the subpoena last year, seeking financial records that the Republican president and his company had provided to the bank, the Times said, citing four unnamed people. The office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance declined to confirm or deny the report. Deutsche Bank and the White House did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. The Times said Deutsche Bank complied with the subpoena and provided prosecutors with \u201cdetailed records, including financial statements and other materials\u201d that Trump had provided to the bank as he sought loans. Vance, a Democrat, this week suggested a grand jury subpoena for Trump\u2019s tax returns was part of an investigation of \u201cpossibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization,\u201d including alleged insurance and bank fraud. Vance\u2019s investigation into Trump and the Trump Organization was spurred by disclosures of hush payments to two women who said they had had sexual relationships with Trump before he became president. Trump has denied the claims. Vance, who is seeking to dismiss Trump\u2019s latest challenge to the subpoena for eight years of personal and corporate tax records, raised the scope of the probe in court papers filed in federal court in Manhattan on Monday. While Deutsche Bank\u2019s response to the subpoena \u201creinforces the seriousness of the legal threat\u201d the investigation poses for the Republican president and his business, the inquiry is still at an early stage, the Times said, citing an unnamed person.",
        "summarized_context": "New York prosecutors have subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for financial records related to President Trump and his company. The subpoena is part of a wider criminal inquiry into Trump's business practices, which initially focused on hush money payments made in 2016. The investigation now suggests possible bank and insurance fraud. Deutsche Bank, Trump's longtime lender, complied with the subpoena and turned over financial statements and other documents. Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, previously testified that Trump inflated the value of his assets to secure loans. Trump and his company deny any wrongdoing. The investigations have been criticized as politically motivated by Trump."

            "\u00a9 Provided by NBC News\nA federal judge on Thursday denied President Donald Trump\u2019s latest attempt to quash a probe by New York prosecutors seeking his tax returns and other financial documents.\nThe ruling by U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero amounted to a second loss in Trump\u2019s high-stakes court battle with Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance.\nMarrero had rejected Trump\u2019s initial attempt to block a subpoena from Vance seeking eight years of his tax returns.\nThe Supreme Court ruled last month that the president is not immune from a grand jury subpoena while in office but allowed him to make an alternative argument to fight it.\nIn his 103-page ruling, Marrero rejected Trump\u2019s new argument that Vance\u2019s subpoena is \u201cwildly broad\u201d and was issued in \u201cbad faith.\u201d\n\u201cAt its core, it amounts to absolute immunity through a back door, an entry point through which not only a President but also potentially other persons and entities, public and private, could effectively gain cover from judicial process,\u201d Marrero wrote.\nThe decision moves Vance one step closer to obtaining the president's financial records. But within just a few hours of the ruling, Trump's lawyers filed an emergency motion appealing the decision and asking for a freeze on the case.\n\u201dThe President respectfully disagrees with that decision and believes there is a likelihood of reversal on appeal,\u201d Trump's lawyers wrote. \u201dBut what matters most at this point is that, absent a stay, the subpoena will be enforced before the President has been afforded any appellate review of his overbreadth and bad-faith claims.\u201d\nVance\u2019s office subpoenaed Trump\u2019s accounting firm, Mazars USA, in 2019 as part of an investigation into payments the Trump Organization made to two women who have alleged affairs with the president, which he has denied. In a court filing this month, Vance\u2019s office suggested the investigation goes beyond the payments to include alleged insurance and bank fraud.\nA spokesman for Vance\u2019s office declined comment.",
            "A federal judge rejected President Trump\u2019s motion for a stay pending appeal the day after a challenge to a Manhattan district attorney\u2019s subpoena for his financial records and tax returns was tossed out.\nJudge Victor Marrero of the Southern District of New York released a 103-page ruling on Thursday siding with Cyrus Vance, the district attorney of New York County, and rejecting the president\u2019s efforts to continue the fight at the district court level by dismissing the Trump legal team\u2019s effort. He followed up Friday by denying Trump\u2019s request for a pause while his legal team asks an appeals court to take up the case.\nTo obtain a stay, the judge said, Trump would have to demonstrate \u201cirreparable harm in the absence of the injunction and either a likelihood of success on the merits or sufficiently serious questions going to the merits.\u201d Marrero said the president has not proven this, arguing that the court would be rejecting Trump\u2019s request for pretty much the same reasons it rejected a similar request last October.\n\u201cBecause a grand jury is under a legal obligation to keep the confidentiality of its records, the Court finds that no irreparable harm will ensue from the disclosure to it of the President\u2019s records sought here,\u201d the judge ruled, adding, \u201cThere is no sign that the Supreme Court contemplated any further appellate proceedings, and in fact appeared to agree with the Second Circuit that the case should be remanded back to the District Court. Furthermore \u2026 the Court is not persuaded that appellate review would be successful in any event.\u201d\nThe judge also noted concerns \u201cregarding the effect of further delay on the grand jury\u2019s investigation.\u201d\n\u201cThe concept of temporary absolute immunity would bear adverse consequences for the fair and effective administration of justice,\u201d Marrero said Thursday.\nTrump\u2019s legal team quickly filed an emergency notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that day. \u201cThe President respectfully disagrees with that decision and believes there is a likelihood of reversal on appeal,\u201d Trump attorney William Consovoy said.\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office issued a court filing earlier in August that appears to show that it is investigating potential bank and insurance fraud in the Trump Organization.\nProsecutors did not explicitly identify the focus of their investigation but said that \u201dundisputed\u201d news reports about the organization's business conduct provide a legitimate basis for their subpoena seeking the president's financial records. Those reports claim that Trump inflated his net worth and the values of his properties to lenders and insurers. The president's legal team asserts that he did nothing wrong.\n\u201cSpecial standing within the governmental scheme at times could come into conflict with other basic principles; it cannot equate under all circumstances to special privilege and special treatment of the President much greater than legally or practically justifiable, and far beyond the official standards applied to govern the affairs of ordinary citizens,\u201d Marrero ruled Thursday.\nThe Supreme Court ruled in July that the president must allow the state of New York to examine his financial records as part of a grand jury criminal investigation. The case, Trump v. Vance, pertains to the district attorney for New York County asking for eight years' worth of Trump's personal tax returns in connection with a grand jury investigation. The documents are material for which the president may not claim executive privilege.\nIn late July, Trump\u2019s attorneys argued in court that Vance\u2019s subpoena \u201cis wildly overbroad and is not remotely confined to the grand jury investigation that began in 2018\u201d and \u201cwas issued in bad faith.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court ruled in a 7-2 decision that \u201cArticle II and the Supremacy Clause do not categorically preclude, or require a heightened standard for, the issuance of a state criminal subpoena\u201d to a sitting president.\n\u201cTwo hundred years ago, a great jurist of our Court established that no citizen, not even the president, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote.\n\u201dThis is all a political prosecution,\u201d Trump tweeted after that ruling. \u201dI won the Mueller Witch Hunt, and others, and now I have to keep fighting in a politically corrupt New York. Not fair to this Presidency or Administration!\u201d\n"

            "(CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a wave of lame duck pardons, including two for men who pleaded guilty in Robert Mueller's investigation , as well as ones for Republican allies who once served in Congress and military contractors involved in a deadly shooting of Iraqi civilians.\nThe pardons of former campaign aide George Papadopoulos , former US congressmen Duncan Hunter and Chris Collins , and the four Blackwater guards involved in the Iraq massacre kick off what is expected to be a flurry of pardons and commutations in the coming weeks as Trump concludes his term.\nAlso included in the batch announced on Tuesday are Alex van der Zwaan , the Dutch lawyer who was sentenced to 30 days in jail after pleading guilty to lying to Mueller investigators; two Border Patrol agents convicted in 2006 of shooting and wounding an unarmed undocumented immigrant and then covering it up; and several people convicted of non-violent drug crimes serving lengthy sentences.\nThe pardons came at the recommendation of Trump allies in Congress and, in some cases, the conservative media. Many of the non-violent drug offenders were recommended for clemency by Alice Johnson , the former federal inmate whose sentence Trump commuted at the urging of Kim Kardashian West.\nThe announcement Tuesday also included commuting the remaining prison term of former Rep. Steve Stockman, a Texas Republican who was convicted by a jury in Texas of almost two dozen felonies, including fraud and money laundering.\nIn the release, the White House cited Stockman's age, 64, and said he \u201dhas underlying pre-existing health conditions that place his health at greater risk during the COVID epidemic , and he has already contracted COVID while in prison.\u201d He had served two years of his 10-year sentence for what prosecutors called a \u201da white-collar crime spree.\u201d\nOthers included in the clemency batch on Tuesday were pardons for Alfonso Costa, a dentist who pleaded guilty to health care fraud; Alfred Lee Crum, who pleaded guilty in 1952 to illegally distilling moonshine; Weldon Angelos, who was sentenced to 55 years in prison for selling marijuana and carrying a handgun; Philip Lyman, a county commissioner in Utah who was sentenced to 10 days in jail related to his protest of ATV restrictions on federal land; and Otis Gordon, who was convicted of possession with intent to distribute.\nPhilip Esformes, a Florida nursing home mogul convicted of paying bribes in a Medicare fraud case, also had some of his sentence commuted by Trump.\nTrump also reduced the sentences of three women -- Crystal Munoz, Tynice Nichole Hall and Judith Negron -- convicted of drug crimes at the recommendation of Johnson, who has worked on behalf of other inmates after the President commuted her own sentence. Trump later granted Johnson a full pardon at this year's Republican National Convention.\nMueller investigation pardons\nGeorge Papadopoulos visits \u201dThe Story With Martha MacCallum\u201d at Fox News Studios on March 26, 2019 in New York City.\nThe pardons give forgiveness to two early defendants who pleaded guilty and served prison time in the Mueller investigation: 2016 campaign foreign policy adviser Papadopoulos and Van der Zwaan, who was part of a major investigation by Mueller into illegal foreign lobbying efforts and the Ukrainian and Russian connections of Trump campaign adviser Paul Manafort.\nBoth Papadopoulos and Van der Zwaan pleaded guilty to lying to investigators during the Russia investigation. And neither provided Mueller with any meaningful cooperation, prosecutors said.\nPapadopoulos had lied to investigators about his contacts with people connected to Russia, including discussing with them \u201ddirt\u201d that could hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016 and a possible trip by Trump during the campaign to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nAt his sentencing, Papadopoulos' then-lawyer called him \u201dpro-FBI\u201d and said he had lied so he might still be considered for a job in the Trump administration. The defense lawyer, Thomas Breen, effectively blamed Trump for publicly urging people such as Papadopoulos to disregard the Russia investigators. \u201dThe President of the United States hindered this investigation more than George Papadopoulos ever could,\u201d Breen argued.\n\u201dI made a terrible mistake,\u201d Papadopoulos told the judge during his sentencing hearing. \u201dIn hindsight, lying to federal agents about such a critical issue could have harmed our nation.\u201d\nHe spent less than two weeks in prison in late 2018. Since then, he's railed against the investigators and how they caught him.\nVan der Zwaan, who is also the son-in-law of the Ukrainian-Russian billionaire German Khan, spent almost a month in prison before being deported to Europe in June 2018. He showed \u201dmuted\u201d remorse at his sentencing, the judge noted.\nAttorney Alex van der Zwaan leaves U.S District Court after pleading guilty during a scheduled appearance February 20, 2018 in Washington, DC.\n\u201dThis is not something that happened to him. This is something he did,\u201d federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson said at Van der Zwaan's sentencing. \u201dHe put his personal interest ahead of the interest of justice.\u201d\nMore recently, Papadopoulos ran for Congress in California's 25th District in 2019 following Democratic Rep. Katie Hill's resignation. He lost the race for the open seat in the March primary.\nFormer congressmen pardoned\nHunter, who was sentenced earlier this year to 11 months in prison and three years of supervised release related to his misuse of more than $200,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses, was recommended for a pardon by \u201dmany members of Congress,\u201d according to the White House release.\nThe former California lawmaker pleaded guilty in December 2019 to one count of conspiracy to misuse campaign funds and was set to be on supervised release for three years after serving his prison sentence. He was also required to participate in a drug and alcohol treatment program. Hunter would have started his sentence in May, but it was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic, and he would have reported to a federal prison in West Texas in January 2021.\nHunter and his wife were indicted in August 2018 for lavishly spending on \u201ditems as inconsequential as fast food, movie tickets and sneakers; as trivial as video games, Lego sets and Playdoh; as mundane as groceries, dog food, and utilities; and as self-indulgent as luxury hotels, overseas vacations, and plane tickets for themselves, their family members, and their pet rabbits Eggburt and Cadbury,\u201d according to prosecutors.\nFederal prosecutors charged that Hunter had fraudulently spent more than $200,000 on expenses that included a $14,000 Italian vacation and thousands of dollars on routine items like groceries, bedding and other household items.\nHunter resigned from Congress in January, after winning reelection in California's 50th Congressional District, which encompasses much of eastern San Diego County.\nCollins, a former New York congressman, has been serving his 26-month prison sentence in a minimum-security federal prison in Florida since October.\nCollins pleaded guilty in October 2019 to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and one count of making a false statement.\nWhile attending the White House's annual congressional picnic in June 2017, Collins had shared non-public information with his son Cameron about the failed trial results for a multiple sclerosis drug the Australian biotech company Innate Immunotherapeutics Limited, of which he was a board member, was developing. He later lied to FBI agents to cover it up. The stock trades allowed Cameron Collins, a co-defendant in the case, to avoid over $750,000 in losses, according to federal prosecutors. Collins himself did not trade on the information.\nCollins had initially fought the charges against him, calling them \u201dmeritless\u201d when they were first brought in 2018. He even won reelection while under indictment. But in his guilty plea last year in federal court, Collins expressed regret and said that putting his son \u201din this jeopardy at this young age ... is something I will live with for the rest of my life.\u201d\nCollins resigned from Congress on September 30, 2019, a day before his guilty plea. He had represented New York's 27th Congressional District for nearly seven years.\nBlackwater guards\nThis combination made from file photo shows Blackwater guards, from left, Dustin Heard, Evan Liberty, Nicholas Slatten and Paul Slough.\nThe four Blackwater guards \u2014 Nicholas Slatten, Paul Slough, Evan Liberty, and Dustin Heard \u2014 were convicted by a federal jury in 2014 after a lengthy trial that saw some 30 witnesses travel from Iraq to testify against them. Prosecutors accused the men of illegally unleashing \u201dpowerful sniper fire, machine guns and grenade launchers on innocent men, women and children.\u201d\nAccording to prosecutors, the four were among seven Blackwater employees who opened fire in the Nusoor Square traffic circle in Baghdad, killing 17 people.\nAn FBI investigation found 14 of the deaths unjustified, according to rules of engagement for private security contractors in Iraq. Slatten was accused of firing the first shots.\nBlackwater said its convoy came under attack, and defense attorneys said in court that witness accounts were fabricated. But witnesses testified that the contractors opened fire without provocation.\nThe White House said their pardons were supported by a number of members of Congress along with Pete Hegseth, the conservative Fox News host who is an ally of the President's.\nThe controversial private security firm was founded by Erik Prince, the brother of Trump's education secretary, Betsy DeVos\nBorder Patrol agents\nThe two Border Patrol agents, Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean, received 11- and 12-year prison sentences for their role in the 2006 shooting. Their sentences were later reduced through presidential commutation by George W. Bush.\nThe shooting happened February 17, 2005, on the US-Mexico border southeast of El Paso, Texas. During their trial, Ramos and Compean said that the illegal immigrant, Osvaldo Aldrete-Davila, had brandished a gun while actively resisting arrest.\nAldrete-Davila said, however, that he was unarmed and trying to surrender when Compean attempted to beat him with a shotgun.\nAldrete-Davila was shot while fleeing toward the Rio Grande. Ramos and Compean were convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon, lying about the incident and violating Aldrete-Davila's Fourth Amendment right against illegal search and seizure.\nAfter receiving immunity to testify in the case against the two agents, Aldrete-Davila was arrested in 2007 on charges of bringing more than 750 pounds of marijuana into the United States.\nThe case became a political flashpoint, with advocates of tighter border controls defending the agents and civil liberties groups saying that the agents had used illegal and excessive force against Aldrete-Davila.\nThis story has been updated.",

(Noam Galai/Getty Images)\nTrump Officially Pardons Former Campaign Aide George Papadopoulos, 14 Others\nPresident Donald Trump on Dec. 22 pardoned George Papadopoulos, his former campaign aide who pleaded guilty as part of the probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\nIn a wave of pre-Christmas pardons, the president pardoned Papadopoulos, 33, as well as 14 others, including several former GOP congressmen. The White House said in a statement that the president was granting full pardons to 15 people and commuted part or all of the sentences of five others.\nAlex van der Zwaan, 36, a Belgian-born Dutch national, was one of the 15 granted a full pardon by Trump. He was sentenced to 30 days in prison in April 2018 for lying to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigators about contacts with an official in the president\u2019s 2016 campaign.\nOthers pardoned include former Republican Reps. Duncan Hunter of California and Chris Collins of New York and four former Blackwater contractors convicted in the deaths of Iraqi civilians in Nisour Square in Baghdad, including Nicholas Slatten, a former contractor for the company.\nPapadopoulos pleaded guilty in October 2017 to one count of making false statements. In the plea deal, Papadopoulos admitted to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese professor whom the Mueller team cast as a figure deeply connected to Russian officials. Open-source research indicates that Mifsud has extensive ties to Western intelligence, rather than Russia.\nAfter his sentencing, Papadopoulos embarked on a media spree, alleging, in part, that he was the victim of an international intelligence conspiracy to shape the 2016 presidential election and undermine Trump.\nHe served 12 days of a 14-day sentence in federal prison and was subsequently placed on a 12-month supervised release.\nThe White House said in a statement: \u201cNotably, Mueller stated in his report that he found no evidence of collusion in connection with Russia\u2019s attempts to interfere in the election. Nonetheless, the Special Counsel\u2019s team still charged Mr. Papadopoulos with this process-related crime.\n\u201cAt the time that Mr. Papadopoulos allegedly made the false statements, he was not represented by counsel, and, after he was arrested, Mr. Papadopoulos gave additional information on his prior statements to the Special Counsel.\n\u201cToday\u2019s pardon helps correct the wrong that Mueller\u2019s team inflicted on so many people.\u201d\nPapadopoulos thanked Trump in a statement on Twitter, saying that the decision \u201cmeans the world to me and my family.\u201d\nThe series of pardons comes just weeks after the president pardoned former national security adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn amid a four-year criminal case.\nFlynn had pleaded guilty to lying during a 2017 FBI interview about his conversations with then-Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak during Trump\u2019s 2016 transition period. But Flynn, who is represented by high-profile attorney Sidney Powell, later withdrew his plea, saying that he had accepted a plea deal because prosecutors were threatening his son with charges and his former lawyers hadn\u2019t represented him effectively. He also repeatedly accused the government of misconduct related to his case.\nIvan Pentchoukov and Reuters contributed to this report."

        "context": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump granted a full pardon on Tuesday to George Papadopoulos, a former campaign aide who pleaded guilty as part of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Trump also pardoned Alex van der Zwaan, 36, the Dutch son-in-law of Russian billionaire German Khan. Van der Zwaan was sentenced to 30 days in prison and fined $20,000 for lying to U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigators about contacts with an official in Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. Their names were included in a wave of pre-Christmas pardons announced by the White House. Trump granted full pardons to 15 people and commuted all or part of the sentences of five others. The list of pardons and commutations included three former Republican lawmakers. Also pardoned were former U.S. service members - Nicholas Slatten, Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard - who were convicted of killing Iraqi civilians while working as contractors in 2007. Papadopoulos, 33, was an adviser to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. He pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to FBI agents about the timing and significance of his contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s crime was serious and caused damage to the government\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election,\u201d a sentencing recommendation memo from then-U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had said. He served 12 days of a 14-day sentence in federal prison, then was placed on a 12-month supervised release. The White House said Papadopoulos was charged with \u201ca process-related crime, one count of making false statements,\u201d as part of the Mueller probe, which Trump had denounced as a witch hunt. \u201cToday\u2019s pardon helps correct the wrong that Mueller\u2019s team inflicted on so many people,\u201d the White House said. The pardons were part of a flurry of such actions expected by the outgoing Republican president before Democratic President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20. Trump, who has refused to concede, has made unsubstantiated claims of widespread voting fraud and pursued a series of unsuccessful lawsuits to overturn the result. Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said Trump was abusing power by issuing the pardons, \u201cto reward his friends and political allies, to protect those who lie to cover up him, to shelter those guilty of killing civilians, and to undermine an investigation that uncovered massive wrongdoing.\u201d Last month, Trump pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during the Russia investigation. The Flynn pardon drew condemnation from Democrats and other critics. In July, Trump commuted the sentence of longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone, sparing him from prison after he was convicted of lying under oath to lawmakers investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Slideshow ( 3 images ) FORMER LAWMAKERS Also receiving pardons or a sentence commutation on Tuesday were three former Republican lawmakers, including former Representative Chris Collins of New York. Collins, 70, had been the first sitting member of Congress to endorse Trump\u2019s candidacy in 2016 and was a strong defender of the president. He won re-election in 2018 but resigned the next year. Slideshow ( 3 images ) \u201cIn 2019, Collins pled guilty to the charges of conspiring to commit securities fraud and making false statements to the FBI. Mr. Collins is currently serving his 26-month sentence,\u201d the White House said. Trump also issued a full pardon to former Republican Representative Duncan Hunter of California, 44, who pleaded guilty a year ago to a single count of conspiring to convert campaign funds to personal use, a felony carrying a maximum penalty of five years in prison. The president commuted the remaining prison term of former Republican Representative Steve Stockman of Texas, 64, who was convicted in 2018 of misuse of charitable funds. The White House said he had served more than two years of his 10-year sentence and would remain subject to a period of supervised release and an order requiring that he pay more than $1 million in restitution. Trump also commuted the remaining term of the supervised release of Crystal Munoz, who was convicted of conspiracy to distribute marijuana. Munoz spent years in a federal prison in Fort Worth, with Alice Johnson, who was granted clemency by Trump in 2018 in a case championed by reality TV star Kim Kardashian West.",
        "summarized_context": "President Donald Trump has issued a series of pardons, including one for his former campaign aide George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Trump also pardoned several former Republican congressmen, military contractors involved in the shooting of Iraqi civilians, and individuals convicted of non-violent drug crimes. The pardons were recommended by Trump allies in Congress and conservative media figures. The move is expected to be followed by more pardons and commutations in the coming weeks as Trump's term concludes."

            "PHOTO: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\nPresident-elect Joe Biden will aim to release every available dose of the coronavirus vaccine when he takes office, a break with the Trump administration\u2019s strategy of holding back half of US vaccine production to ensure second doses are available.\nWhat this means: Releasing all vaccine doses on hand could quickly ratchet up the availability of coronavirus vaccines by allowing more people access to a first dose. It could also be a risky strategy as both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna\u2019s vaccines require two doses, administered at specific intervals, and vaccine manufacturing has not ramped up as rapidly as many experts had hoped.\nThe comment from Biden\u2019s transition comes after a group of governors wrote a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Operation Warp Speed Chief Operating Officer Gen. Gustave Perna pressing the federal government to distribute \u201creserved doses\u201d of the Covid-19 vaccine to states that need them.\n\u201cOur states are ready to work around the clock to ramp up distribution, get more shots in arms, and save more American lives. General Perna, as you have stated before, \u2018a vaccine sitting on a shelf is not effective,\u2019\u201d the letter reads. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t agree with you more. That\u2019s why we are asking for your help now. When we work together, we can end this pandemic and return to a life of normalcy sooner.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has insisted it\u2019s necessary to hold back doses to ensure Americans who receive the first course of the two-dose vaccine will be sure to have access to a second dose. But the move has sparked a debate about whether a better strategy would be releasing all available doses as quickly as possible, particularly amid rising death and hospitalization rates. A study published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine also found that administering first doses of a Covid-19 vaccine to more individuals instead of withholding available supply for use as a second dose may reduce the number of new cases.\n\u201cOperation Warp Speed is continuing to ensure second doses are available to vaccine administration sites, at appropriate intervals, as directed by jurisdiction leaders,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cWe would be delighted to learn that jurisdictions have actually administered many more doses than they are presently reporting. We are encouraging jurisdictions to expand their priority groups as needed to ensure no vaccine is sitting on the shelf after having been delivered to the jurisdiction-directed locations.\u201d\nThe spokesperson also noted the US Food and Drug Administration recently reiterated the importance of requiring two doses for both the Pfizer and Modern vaccines.\nMore on the vaccines: The vaccines by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are both about 95% effective after two full doses.\nEarlier this week, two top officials from the FDA said anyone who receives those vaccines needs both doses, dismissing the idea of stretching the supply by allowing just one dose or cutting doses in half.\nThey also dismissed other ideas for stretching the vaccine supply and said people who are speculating about the possibility of making do with just one dose or cutting doses in half are misinterpreting the data.\n\u201cWe have been following the discussions and news reports about reducing the number of doses, extending the length of time between doses, changing the dose (half-dose), or mixing and matching vaccines in order to immunize more people against COVID-19,\u201d FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn and Dr. Peter Marks, who heads FDA\u2019s vaccine division, said in a statement.\n\u201cThese are all reasonable questions to consider and evaluate in clinical trials. However, at this time, suggesting changes to the FDA-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence. Without appropriate data supporting such changes in vaccine administration, we run a significant risk of placing public health at risk, undermining the historic vaccination efforts to protect the population from COVID-19,\u201d they added.\nHahn and Marks also said the data supports giving the second dose of each vaccine at the specified interval \u2014 21 days after the first dose for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 28 days after the first dose for the Moderna vaccine.\nAccording to the study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday, by reducing the amount of the vaccine doses withheld to 10% for the first three weeks and supplying a steady dose of 6 million doses per week, the US could avoid up to 29% more cases over eight weeks.\nThe US government currently withholds 50% of the available vaccine supply, distributing to states and other jurisdictions weeks later to be administered as the second in a 2-dose series.\nThe researchers modeled various scenarios, with variables including vaccine supply, protection provided by the first dose and waning efficacy of the first dose if the second dose is delayed. Only in the unlikely worst-case scenario of a collapse in supply and minimal protection among individuals who have received the first dose would the model suggest that withholding 50% of available supply provides better protection.\n\u201cWe find that under most plausible scenarios, a more balanced approach that withholds fewer doses during early distribution in order to vaccinate more people as soon as possible could substantially increase the benefits of vaccines, while enabling most recipients to receive second doses on schedule,\u201d write the study\u2019s authors, who were supported by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
            "Biden Plans to Release Almost All COVID-19 Vaccine Doses After Taking Office\nPresident-elect Joe Biden plans to release nearly all available doses of the COVID-19 vaccines after he takes office, a spokesperson said Friday.\n\u201cThe president-elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the Americans who need it most get it as soon as possible,\u201d T.J. Ducklo, a spokesman for the transition team, told news outlets in a statement.\n\u201cHe supports releasing available doses immediately, and believes the government should stop holding back vaccine supply so we can get more shots in Americans\u2019 arms now. He will share additional details next week on how his Administration will begin releasing available doses when he assumes office on January 20th,\u201d Ducklo added.\nTwo vaccines have been authorized for emergency use by drug regulators, one from Moderna and one from Pfizer and BioNTech. Both are centered around messenger RNA platforms and require two doses, spaced apart about three weeks, for full effectiveness.\nTrump administration officials have chosen to hold back doses in order to guarantee that patients who get one shot will have a second dose available when three weeks elapses.\nDr. Moncef Slaoui, Operation Warp Speed\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said during an event last month that releasing all doses without holding any back for people\u2019s second injection would be leaving them \u201ccompletely in the dark.\u201d\nModeling showed giving everyone their first dose and being unprepared to give people second doses wasn\u2019t realistic, he added.\nThe Biden team feels otherwise, as evidenced by the new announcement.\nSyringes containing the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine sit in a tray in a vaccination room at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, Calif., on Jan. 7, 2021. (Jae C. Hong/AP Photo)\nThe announcement came after a group of eight Democratic governors, including Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Operation Warp Speed Chief Operating Officer General Gustave Perna.\nIn the letter, the governors asked the federal government to begin distributing \u201creserved doses\u201d to states, immediately.\nAccording to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, many states have not administered even half of the vaccine doses they\u2019re received. Michigan, for instance, has gotten 662,450 doses but has only given 137,887 doses. New York has received 1.1 million doses but has only administered 353,788.\nSlaoui and others involved in the vaccine development and distribution said they believed 20 million Americans would be vaccinated by the end of 2020, but just 5.9 million have gotten one of the shots as of 9 a.m. on Thursday. While some officials have blamed the states\u2014over 21 million doses have been distributed to states\u2014that\u2019s still far short of the projection.\nBiden and his advisers have criticized the slow rollout, which Trump administration officials expect to get faster. He has also vowed that 100 million people would be vaccinated in his first 100 days in office, a feat that would be difficult but possible, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\nA Biden adviser last month said he would utilize the Defense Production Act to quicken the production of vaccines, like President Donald Trump did last year to speed the production of ventilators and other items.\n\u201cThe idea there is to make sure the personal protective equipment, the test capacity, and the raw materials for the vaccines are produced in adequate supply,\u201d Dr. Celine Gounder, a member of Biden\u2019s COVID-19 advisory board, said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d"

        "context": "(Corrects to show Biden spokesman made comments on vaccine, not the president-elect) NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - President-elect Joe Biden wants to release more available doses of coronavirus vaccines when he takes office, a spokesman said on Friday, as the United States capped the first week of the new year with a slew of grim records set by the raging pandemic. The U.S. rollout of vaccines has begun slowly as hospitals have not been able to give the shots as quickly as they have received them. A federal program aimed at inoculating residents and staff at long-term care homes has also lagged. There is no federal infrastructure in place for giving vaccines, and states are each designing their own plans, with little funding to do so. The monumental effort has fallen far short of the 20 million vaccination goal the Trump Administration had vowed to reach by the end of 2020. \u201cThe President-elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the Americans who need it most get it as soon as possible,\u201d TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Biden\u2019s transition, told Reuters. The announcement marked a departure from the Trump administration\u2019s strategy of holding back a supply to make sure second doses of the vaccines are available. Biden, a Democrat, will succeed President Donald Trump at the helm of the nation in less than two weeks. A group of Democratic governors, including those of California, New York, Washington, Illinois and Michigan, this week sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar urging Washington to distribute \u201cthe millions of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine doses that are currently being held back by the Trump administration.\u201d As of Thursday, roughly 6 million people across the United States had received a first injection of the vaccines, accounting for less than one-third of more than 21 million doses shipped to date, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Top health officials this week announced plans to increase vaccine distribution as pressure builds on healthcare systems. Azar also told governors to not let vaccines go unused due to policies requiring healthcare workers to get the shots first. The pandemic showed no sign of abating this week, claiming the lives of more than 4,000 people across the country for the second consecutive day on Thursday, or one life lost every 22 seconds, according to a Reuters analysis of public health data. With a total of over 365,000 deaths, one in every 895 U.S. residents has died of COVID-19 since the pandemic started, according to Reuters calculations. The latest virus surge has been compounded by the spread of a new, more infectious coronavirus variant first detected in the United Kingdom that has now been found in at least eight U.S. states. More than 132,000 Americans were hospitalized due to the coronavirus as of late Thursday night and the total number of cases nationwide rose to a staggering 21.5 million as strict mitigation measures further taxed the fragile U.S. economy. The loss of 140,000 nonfarm payrolls in December, reported by the Labor Department on Friday, was concentrated in the leisure and hospitality sector, which have been especially hard-hit by the pandemic, with closures of bars and restaurants accounting for three-quarters of the job losses. Even so, better-performing sectors such as retail, manufacturing and construction offered hope the nation would not slip back into recession, together with the prospect of more fiscal stimulus now that Democrats have gained control of the U.S. Senate.

            "(CNN) FBI Director Christopher Wray said Thursday that there hasn't been a coordinated national voter fraud effort in past elections, regardless of the method of voting.\n\u201dNow, we have not seen, historically, any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it's by mail or otherwise,\u201d he said before a Senate panel in response to a question on whether voting by mail is secure.\nHowever, there has been voter fraud at the local level \u201dfrom time to time,\u201d Wray told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee during a hearing on threats to the homeland, adding that the FBI takes seriously the responsibility to investigate such fraud.\n\u201dCertainly to change a federal election outcome by mounting that kind of fraud at scale would be a major challenge for an adversary, but people should make no mistake, we're vigilant as to the threat and watching it carefully because we're in an uncharted new territory,\u201d he said.\nAt a House hearing last week, Wray said that Russia has been \u201dvery active\u201d in its efforts to influence US elections, with the primary goal being to \u201ddenigrate\u201d Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, echoing the intelligence community's public assessment of Moscow's meddling efforts issued last month.\nPresident Donald Trump and several other top administration officials have recently attempted to play up the theory that China is meddling to get Biden elected, while downplaying well-founded reports that Russia is trying to help Trump win again, like it did in 2016.\nTrump pushed back on Wray's comments last week, tweeting , \u201dBut Chris, you don't see any activity from China, even though it is a FAR greater threat than Russia, Russia, Russia. They will both, plus others, be able to interfere in our 2020 Election with our totally vulnerable Unsolicited (Counterfeit?) Ballot Scam. Check it out!,\u201d along with a C-SPAN link to Wray's remarks.\nTrump has repeatedly dismissed Russia's ongoing election-meddling and played up the notion that China is actively meddling in the election.\nThe President also told reporters last week he \u201ddid not like\u201d Wray's answers on the Hill, but wouldn't say if he were considering replacing him.\n\u201dWe're looking at a lot of different things,\u201d Trump said, when asked if he would replace Wray. \u201dAnd I don't -- I did not like his answers yesterday, and I'm not sure he liked them either. I'm sure that he probably would agree with me,\u201d he said on the south lawn of the White House Friday.\nTrump also took issue with Wray's testimony last week about Antifa, which the FBI director -- pressed on the issue mainly by Republicans -- said is not a group or organization but rather a movement or ideology.\n\u201dWe look at Antifa as more of an ideology or a movement than an organization. To be clear, we do have quite a number of properly predicated domestic terrorism investigations into violent anarchist extremists, any number of whom self-identify with the Antifa movement, and that's part of this broader group of domestic violent extremists,\u201d Wray said.\nTrump wasn't satisfied. \u201dAntifa is a bad group and they're criminals and they're anarchists and they're agitators and they're looters and rioters and everything else. They're bad and when a man doesn't say that, that bothers me. I wonder why he's not saying that,\u201d he said.\nInvestigations into extremists\nDuring Thursday's Senate hearing, Wray emphasized the threat from Antifa, saying some of his comments from last week's hearing were \u201dmore clearly conveyed than others.\u201d\n\u201dAntifa is a real thing, it is not a fiction,\u201d Wray said. \u201dWe have seen organized tactical activity at both the local and regional level. We have seen Antifa adherents coalescing and working together in what I would describe as small groups and nodes.\u201d\nThe FBI director said there are a number of investigations into violent anarchist extremists, some of whom self-identify with Antifa. He also pointed out that there are \u201dmilitia types,\u201d which the FBI is investigating as well.\nWray said there are three broad categories participating in protests across the country: The largest group is peaceful protesters. There are also criminal opportunists, and then \u201dby far and away the most dangerous,\u201d he said, are people violating federal law. Wray said motivations vary, but the FBI has seen a number of \u201dviolent anarchist extremists\u201d participating in the mix.\n\u201dTrying to put a lot of these things into nice, neat, clean buckets is a bit of a challenge,\u201d he added.\nWray pointed out that the majority of recent protests across the country have been peaceful, adding that the FBI has opened investigations on individuals involved in \u201dcriminal activity at these protests.\u201d\n\u201dNow let me be clear, we do not investigate groups or individuals based on ideology or on the exercise of First Amendment protected activity alone, but when the ideology leads someone to commit criminal acts and pursue violence, the FBI will not hesitate to take appropriate action,\u201d he said.\nWhite supremacists pose most lethal threat\nWhite supremacists pose the most lethal terror threat to the nation, said Ken Cuccinelli, the senior official performing the duties of the Deputy Secretary, who was also testifying at the hearing, after he was questioned on why the department had softened language around the issue in recent leaked draft reports.\n\u201dWhen White supremacists act as terrorists, more people per incident are killed. That is a higher lethality. That's what we're referring to,\u201d he said during the Senate hearing, about the department's position on the threat.\nDemocratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada pressed Cuccinelli on why the recently leaked drafts of the soon-to-be-published \u201dHomeland Threat Assessment\u201d showed a change in the language in the assessment about White supremacy. Brian Murphy, a DHS whistleblower, alleged in a complaint that Cuccinelli directed Murphy to modify the section on White supremacy \u201din a manner that made the threat appear less severe, as well as include information on the prominence of violent 'left-wing' groups.\u201d\nCuccinelli denied that the department softened the language, adding, \u201dYou'll see when the final report is out...what you're describing is still in our homeland threat assessment, so your concerns in that regard I can put to rest.\u201d\nWhen asked why he ordered Murphy to downplay the threat, Cuccinelli said, \u201dI absolutely did not do that. That did not happen.\u201d\nHe also addressed another recent DHS whistleblower report that detailed a high rate of hysterectomies and alleged medical neglect in a complaint filed to the Department of Homeland Security inspector general last week.\n\u201dThose are shocking allegations and as a result I immediately dispatched a team from outside of ICE, including a doctor from the Coast Guard, an attorney, and one member of my staff who's a retired army nurse, as well to review the records at that facility,\u201d he said.\nThe documentation indicates two hysterectomies were performed on two women over the course of four years, he said.\nThis story has been updated with background about Wray's comments about Antifa last week.",

Slideshow ( 2 images ) Wray told lawmakers on Thursday he has not seen evidence of a \u201ccoordinated national voter fraud effort,\u201d undercutting the Republican president\u2019s unfounded assault on mail-in balloting before his Nov. 3 contest against Democrat Joe Biden. Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, denigrated Wray during an interview with CBS \u201cThis Morning.\u201d \u201cWith all due respect to Director Wray, he has a hard time finding emails in his own FBI, let alone figuring out whether there\u2019s any kind of voter fraud,\u201d he said without elaborating.

Meadows suggested to CBS that Wray \u201cdrill down on the investigation that just started ... Perhaps he needs to get involved on the ground and then he would change his testimony on Capitol Hill.\u201d The FBI had no comment on Meadows\u2019 remarks.

Asked if Trump had confidence in Wray, Meadows told reporters on Friday he has not spoken to the president about it. Trump himself has repeatedly and without evidence questioned the increased use of mail-in ballots, an established method of voting in the United States.

            "\u00a9 Provided by NBC News\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Donald Trump is leaving office the same way he spent much of his presidency: by putting his party leaders in a vise between their ideological instincts and personal loyalty to him.\nTrump's demand that stimulus payments be raised to a maximum of $2,000 per person was approved by the Democratic-led House. But it faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, where his party's leaders are now torn between conservative orthodoxy and GOP voter demands for loyalty to Trump and their desire to win a crucial Senate election in Georgia on Jan. 5.\nOn Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called for unanimous consent to enhance the approved $600 payments to $2,000. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., objected on behalf of Republicans, blocking the request.\nThe exchange came after Trump held up the $900 billion coronavirus relief package for six days, complaining after it overwhelmingly passed Congress that the $600 stimulus payments were too small. When he ultimately blinked and signed it, the president said he did so with concessions.\n\u201dThe Senate will start the process for a vote that increases checks to $2,000, repeals Section 230 and starts an investigation into voter fraud,\u201d Trump said in a statement.\nDemocrats quickly took him up on the call for $2,000 payments, putting the ball in McConnell's court.\nThe two Georgia GOP senators facing voters next Tuesday, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, have faced pressure from Democratic opponents Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff to back the $2,000 checks. After hesitating, the two Republicans tweeted on Tuesday that they will support the increase to $2,000.\nIt is an uncomfortable spot for two conservative lawmakers who have campaigned heavily against a march to \u201dsocialism\u201d and intrusive government. The new position sets aside their complaints about the national debt since the boost in direct payments would add nearly $464 billion in red ink. And it comes days before Trump is scheduled to rally for them on Monday, the day before the election, near Atlanta.\nTheir Democratic rivals pounced, accusing the Republicans of shifting their positions out of political expedience.\nWarnock said Loeffler has been absent on Covid-19 relief and that \u201dGeorgians learned long ago they can't trust Kelly Loeffler to look out for anyone but herself.\u201d Ossoff highlighted Perdue's past criticisms of direct payments, saying he \u201dhasn\u2019t had a change of heart \u2014 he's exclusively focused on his own political survival.\u201d\nDuring the long and painstaking negotiations that led to the $900 billion package, Republicans resisted the inclusion of more direct payments but ultimately accepted a level of $600 per qualifying American \u2014 half the amount in the CARES Act in March.\nThe stimulus payments are popular at a time of high joblessness as millions of Americans struggle to pay rent and buy food in the pandemic. Rejecting them outright would be painful for the GOP and potentially hurt them in the Georgia runoffs, which will determine which party controls the Senate.\nMcConnell suggested a way out on Tuesday.\nHe unveiled a bill that combines Trump\u2019s three demands \u2014 it boosts the payments to $2,000, repeals an internet liability law known as Section 230 and sets up a commission to investigate the election.\n\u201dThis week, the Senate will begin a process to bring these three priorities into focus,\u201d he said.\nMcConnell\u2019s office did not immediately confirm or comment on the bill, which was circulated Tuesday afternoon by a Democratic leadership aide.\nThe move all but assures the $2,000 checks fail, by forcing lawmakers to approve the medley of policies together or shoot all three down.\nMcConnell\u2019s bill appears designed to placate Trump and give Perdue and Loeffler a way out of their dilemma ahead of the election. But it\u2019s unlikely to become law.\nSchumer called it a \u201ccynical gambit\u201d designed to kill the $2,000 payments.\n\u201cIf Sen. McConnell tries loading up the bipartisan House-passed CASH Act with unrelated, partisan provisions that will do absolutely nothing to help struggling families across the country, it will not pass the House and cannot become law \u2014 any move like this by Sen. McConnell would a blatant attempt to deprive Americans of a $2,000 survival check,\u201d Schumer said in a statement.\nThe question of what to do about Section 230 \u2014 shorthand for an internet liability law that affects social media companies \u2014 divides lawmakers. And any voting measures that bolster Trump's baseless claims of widespread fraud are seen by Democrats as poison pills.\nWhile Trump has voiced support for all three provisions, the president has not demanded that they be tied together. He piled on the pressure for $2,000 payments after McConnell's objection Tuesday, saying a refusal to pass them would amount to \u201da death wish\u201d for Republicans.\nSchumer said the only way to assure the payment hike in this session of Congress is to vote on the CASH Act, which passed the House on Monday with the support of 231 Democrats and 44 Republicans.\nAlso on Tuesday, McConnell said the Senate would vote to \u201dre-approve\u201d a major military authorization bill vetoed by Trump, setting up the first override of his presidency after the House achieved the two-thirds threshold needed for that on Monday.\nBut there's a wrinkle in that plan: Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is threatening to hold up the defense bill unless there is a vote on the $2,000 payments. Such a move could force Loeffler and Perdue to choose between campaigning or staying in Washington to clear procedural hurdles.\n\u201dIf Senator McConnell doesn't agree to an up or down vote to provide the working people of our country a $2,000 direct payment, Congress will not be going home for New Year's Eve,\u201d Sanders said.\nA Sanders spokesman said his objection stands unless McConnell calls a standalone vote on the House-passed CASH Act, calling that \u201dthe only feasible path\u201d to boost the checks before the end of the session.",
            "President Trump\u2019s last-minute about-face on the size of stimulus checks for most Americans to help deal with the economic harm caused by the coronavirus pandemic has turned Washington upside down only days before a new Congress is sworn in.\nTrump\u2019s negotiators had agreed to $600 per person in stimulus checks and had gotten that measure through both the Democratic-controlled House and the Republican-controlled Senate before Christmas. The bill the payments were wrapped into was a typically flawed mixture of needed spending and slabs of Jimmy Dean-sized pork.\nBut Trump\u2019s White House had itself requested much of the pork \u2014 including the foreign aid he\u2019s now railing against \u2014 and never called for $2,000 per person checks until the bill had passed both houses of Congress.\nMCCONNELL BLOCKS QUICK VOTE ON $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS, SAYS SENATE TO BRING TRUMP REQUESTS 'INTO FOCUS'\nBut now suddenly the president says it\u2019s time to add $350 billion to the deficit and is teaming up with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to fight for the extra spending.\nPolitically, the president\u2019s move has created a nightmare for his fellow Republicans.\nTrump tweeted Tuesday: \u201dUnless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2000 payments ASAP. $600 IS NOT ENOUGH!\u201d\nThe president may think he is teaching Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other Republicans a lesson for not supporting him enough in challenging the November election results. But Trump is really damaging the chances that Republicans can hold onto two U.S. Senate seats in Georgia in Tuesday\u2019s runoff elections.\nIf Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock win those two seats, the Senate will be equally divided between Democrats and Republicans, with 50 votes each. As vice president, Kamala Harris will cast a tie-breaking vote to give Democrats the narrowest of majorities.\nIf Democrats capture control of the Senate, you can bet they will endlessly investigate Trump.\nGeorgia Republican Sens. David Perdue (running against Ossoff) and Kelly Loeffler (running against Warnock) now say they back ballooning the deficit with the $2,000 checks to most Americans \u2014 but just a week ago they opposed such a move.\nThree out of four House Republicans voted against the $2,000 checks on Monday. But enough Republicans joined with all but two House Democrats and two independents to approve the boost in payments, enabling it to pass on a 275-to-134 vote. The measure needed 272 votes to pass under suspension of House rules.\n130 HOUSE REPUBLICANS, 2 DEMOCRATS VOTE AGAINST $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS\nWith Republicans split on whether to support or oppose the $2,000 payments, the GOP now appears divided and confused just days before the Georgia runoffs, when it should be united and principled to win the crucial elections.\nSenate Majority Leader McConnell has responded to this mess by buying time.\nIn addition to his $2,000 check proposal, Trump has made additional demands on Congress. McConnell says Trump's demands regarding $2,000 checks, repealing liability protections enjoyed by social media platforms, and investigating voter fraud are \u201dlinked together\u201d and the Senate will start to debate them this week.\nIf all those Trump ideas are packaged into one bill, Democrats will complain that the final product is a poison pill they can\u2019t swallow.\nAnd if this bill combining three separate issues is passed in the Senate, there\u2019s no way a compromise with the House\u2019s version could be agreed to before this Congress turns into a pumpkin on Sunday. At that point, members of the new Congress elected in November take office and will have to start from scratch to come up with new legislation.\nThe irony is that most Republicans and many Democrats know that tossing free money out of a helicopter is a terrible way to help the economy or even individual families.\nStephen Moore, an economist who helped design President Trump\u2019s tax cuts, says: \u201dAre Republicans going to be the party that give us a backdoor Universal Basic Income, i.e. free money for every American? That\u2019s an idea that was laughed off the stage, literally, in the Democratic debates earlier this year.\u201d\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\nMoore argues that the best way to help people is to prudently allow the economy in lockdown states to reopen and get people back to work.\nOn the left, both economist Larry Summers, a former top aide to President Obama, and many progressive policy experts oppose the $2,000 payments, saying it would be better to spend a smaller amount of money on more targeted aid that didn\u2019t go to a lot of families who don\u2019t need it.\nBut common sense is in short supply in Washington right now. The entire town is gripped by a political fever in which both sides are desperate to avoid bad political optics before the crucial Georgia elections.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe late President Calvin Coolidge was a man of few words but those he uttered were often profound. He once observed: \u201dIt is much more important to kill bad bills than to pass good ones.\u201d\nHere\u2019s hoping that Mitch McConnell can find a way to keep the Frankenstein monster of $2,000 checks constructed by the odd couple of Bernie Sanders and President Trump from springing to life. What Congress has already passed is bad enough without making it worse.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM JOHN FUND"

        "context": "WASHINGTON/PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives voted 275-134 to meet President Donald Trump\u2019s demand for $2,000 COVID-19 relief checks on Monday, sending the measure on to an uncertain future in the Republican-controlled Senate. But even as Democrats helped secure approval for what the Republican president sought on stimulus payments, they spearheaded a House vote just a short time later to override his veto of a separate $740 billion defense policy bill. The rebuke, in Trump\u2019s final weeks in office, would be the first veto override of his presidency if seconded by the Senate this week. Trump last week threatened to block a massive pandemic aid and spending package if Congress did not boost stimulus payments from $600 to $2,000 and cut other spending. He backed down from his demands on Sunday as a possible government shutdown loomed, brought on by the fight with lawmakers. But Democratic lawmakers have long wanted much bigger relief checks and used the rare point of agreement with Trump to advance the proposal - or at least to put Republicans on record against it - in the vote on Monday, less than a month before Trump leaves office. SPENDING AND CORONAVIRUS AID PACKAGE The 275 votes for passage meant the stimulus proposal narrowly exceeded the two-thirds of votes cast needed. A total of 130 Republicans, two independents and two Democrats opposed the increased checks on Monday. Trump, who lost November\u2019s election to Democratic challenger Joe Biden but has refused to concede defeat, finally signed the $2.3 trillion package into law Sunday night after holding it up with a veiled veto threat. But he continued demanding $2,000 checks. The $2.3 trillion includes $1.4 trillion in spending to fund government agencies and $892 billion in COVID-19 relief. It is not clear how the measure to increase aid checks will fare in the Senate, where some Republican lawmakers have complained that the higher amount would add hundreds of billions of dollars to the latest relief bill. Increasing the checks would cost $464 billion, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, which prepares cost estimates for legislation before Congress.

REUTERS/Erin Scott/File photo The Senate is due to convene on Tuesday, and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said he would then seek passage of the higher checks bill in the chamber, where Republicans have the majority. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Sunday made no mention of Senate plans for such a vote, after welcoming Trump\u2019s signing of the relief bill. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who has championed higher direct payments to Americans, threatened to stop the Senate from recessing for the New Year\u2019s holiday until McConnell agrees to allow a vote on the $2,000 checks. The coronavirus pandemic has killed nearly 330,000 people in the United States and led to widespread economic hardship, with millions of families relying on unemployment benefits and COVID-19 relief funds. Global markets were buoyed after Trump approved the package. Wall Street\u2019s main indexes hit record highs on Monday as Trump\u2019s signing of the aid bill bolstered bets on an economic recovery and drove gains in financial and energy stocks. PELOSI: \u2018REPUBLICANS HAVE A CHOICE\u2019 As the floor debate was under way, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: \u201cRepublicans have a choice, vote for this legislation, or vote to deny the American people the bigger paychecks that they need.\u201d Democratic Representative Dan Kildee said: \u201cWe would have included much larger payments in the legislation had he (Trump) spoken up sooner. But it\u2019s never too late to do the right thing.\u201d Asked at the end of an event in Wilmington, Delaware, whether he supported expanding the coronavirus payments to $2,000, Biden replied: \u201cYes.\u201d Georgia Republicans Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, who face crucial Senate runoffs next month that will determine who controls the chamber, welcomed Trump\u2019s move, without saying whether the payments should be increased. Republican Representative Kevin Brady said the bill does nothing to help people get back to work. \u201cI worry that as we spend another half a trillion dollars so hastily, that we are not targeting this help to the Americans who are struggling the most and need that help,\u201d he said. The U.S. Treasury Department is anticipating sending the first wave of $600 stimulus checks to individuals and households as early as this week, as previously planned, a senior Treasury official said on Monday. Unemployment benefits being paid out to about 14 million people through pandemic programs lapsed on Saturday, but will be restarted now that Trump has signed the bill. The relief package extends a moratorium on evictions that was due to expire on Dec. 31, refreshes support for small-business payrolls, provides funding to help schools re-open and aid for the transport industry and vaccine distribution. HOUSE OVERRIDES VETO Also in the hands of the Senate, for a vote expected this week, will be whether to override Trump\u2019s veto of the defense bill. In Monday\u2019s 322-87 House vote, which met the two-thirds majority needed, 66 Republicans sided with Trump\u2019s rejection of the bipartisan bill, underscoring deep divisions in the Republican Party. Trump, who is angry that some Republicans have acknowledged his loss to Biden, vetoed the defense bill last Wednesday. He said he was against it because he wanted it to overturn liability protections for social media companies unrelated to national security, and opposed a provision to rename military bases named after generals who fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the Civil War. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters that Trump\u2019s veto had been \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201csmall-minded.\u201d \u201cThis was too irrational a move for the Republicans to rationalize,\u201d the Democratic lawmaker said, predicting that the Senate would take similar action.",
        "summarized_context": "President Trump's demand for $2,000 stimulus payments has put Republican leaders in a difficult position. The Democratic-led House approved the increase, but it faces resistance in the Republican-led Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell objected to the increase, blocking a quick vote. However, the two Georgia GOP senators facing a crucial runoff election have now expressed support for the $2,000 checks. McConnell has proposed a bill that combines the $2,000 payments with repealing Section 230 and investigating voter fraud, but it is unlikely to become law. The situation has created a political nightmare for Republicans ahead of the Georgia runoffs."

            "The House voted overwhelmingly Monday to increase COVID-19 relief checks to $2,000, meeting President Trump\u2019s demand for bigger payments and sending the bill to the GOP-controlled Senate, where the outcome is highly uncertain.\nDemocrats led the passage, 275 to 134, their majority favoring additional assistance, but dozens of Republicans suddenly joined in approval. While Democrats favored bigger checks, Congress had settled on smaller $600 payments in a compromise over the big year-end relief bill Trump reluctantly signed into law. The president\u2019s GOP allies opposed more spending and Trump\u2019s push puts them in a difficult spot.\nThe vote was a stunning turn of events from just days ago, when House Republicans blocked Trump\u2019s demands during a Christmas Eve session. After Trump spent days fuming from his private club in Florida, where he is spending the holidays, dozens of Republicans preferred to link with Democrats rather than buck the outgoing president. Senators were set to return to session Tuesday, forced to consider the measure amid similar, stark GOP divisions.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) declared, \u201cRepublicans have a choice: Vote for this legislation or vote to deny the American people the bigger paychecks they need.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe showdown could end up as more symbolic than substance. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has declined to say publicly how the Senate will handle the bill when Democrats there try to push it forward for a vote Tuesday.\nAfter the robust House vote, Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) warned, \u201cThere is no good reason for Senate Republicans to stand in the way.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s strong support for these $2,000 emergency checks from every corner of the country,\u201d Schumer said in a statement. \u201cLeader McConnell ought to make sure Senate Republicans do not stand in the way of helping to meet the needs of American workers and families who are crying out for help.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe legislative action during the rare holiday week session may do little to change the $2 trillion-plus COVID-19 relief and federal spending package that Trump signed into law Sunday, one of the biggest bills of its kind providing relief for millions of Americans.\nThat package \u2014 $900 billion in COVID-19 aid and $1.4 trillion to fund government agencies \u2014 will deliver long-sought cash to businesses and individuals and avert a federal government shutdown that otherwise would have started Tuesday, amid the public health crisis.\nBut the outcome will define Trump\u2019s GOP, putting a spotlight on the Georgia runoff election Jan. 5 where two Republican senators are in the fights of their political lives against Democrats in a pair of races that will determine which party controls the Senate next year.\nTogether with votes Monday and Tuesday to override Trump\u2019s veto of a sweeping defense bill, it\u2019s potentially one last confrontation between the president and the Republican Party he leads as he imposes fresh demands and disputes the results of the presidential election. The new Congress is set to be sworn in Sunday.\nAdvertisement\nRep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, acknowledged the division and said Congress had already approved ample funds during the COVID-19 crisis. \u201cNothing in this bill helps anybody get back to work,\u201d he said.\nAside from the direct $600 checks to most Americans, the COVID-19 portion of the bill revives a weekly pandemic jobless benefit boost \u2014 this time $300, through March 14 \u2014 as well as a popular Paycheck Protection Program of grants to businesses to keep workers on payrolls. It extends eviction protections, adding a new rental assistance fund.\nThe COVID-19 package draws and expands on an earlier effort from Washington. It offers billions of dollars for vaccine purchases and distribution, for virus contact tracing, public health departments, schools, universities, farmers, food pantry programs and other institutions and groups facing hardship in the pandemic.\nAdvertisement\nAmericans earning up to $75,000 will qualify for the direct $600 payments, which are phased out at higher income levels, and there\u2019s an additional $600 payment per dependent child.\nMeantime, the government funding portion of the bill keeps federal agencies nationwide running without dramatic changes until Sept. 30.\nDemocrats are promising more aid to come once President-elect Joe Biden takes office, but Republicans are signaling a wait-and-see approach.\nBiden told reporters at an event in Wilmington, Del., that he supported the $2,000 checks.\nAdvertisement\nTrump\u2019s sudden decision to sign the bill in Florida, where he is spending the holidays, came as he faced escalating criticism from lawmakers on all sides over his eleventh-hour demands. The bipartisan bill negotiated by Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin had already passed the House and Senate by wide margins. Lawmakers had thought they had Trump\u2019s blessing after months of negotiations with his administration.\nThe president\u2019s defiant refusal to act, publicized with a heated video he tweeted just before the Christmas holiday, sparked chaos, a lapse in unemployment benefits for millions and the threat of a government shutdown in the pandemic. It was another crisis of his own making, resolved when he ultimately signed the bill into law.\nIn his statement about the signing, Trump repeated his frustrations with the COVID-19 relief bill for providing only $600 checks to most Americans and complained about what he considered unnecessary spending, particularly on foreign aid \u2014 much of it proposed by his own budget.\nWhile the president insisted he would send Congress \u201ca redlined version\u201d with spending items he wants removed, those are merely suggestions to Congress. Democrats said they would resist such cuts.\nAdvertisement\nFor now, the administration can begin the work of sending out the $600 payments.\nA day after the signing, Trump was back at the golf course in Florida, the state where he is expected to move after Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20.\nRepublican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, a conservative who supported Trump\u2019s extraordinary and futile challenge of the election results, counted himself Monday among the opponents of a more generous relief package and Trump\u2019s call for higher payments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s money we don\u2019t have, we have to borrow to get and we can\u2019t afford to pay back,\u201d he said on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nBut Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York said she was open to the idea of $2,000 checks. \u201cMany Americans are in dire need of relief,\u201d she said on the show.\nAltogether, Republicans and Democrats alike swiftly welcomed Trump\u2019s decision to sign the bill into law.\n\u201cThe compromise bill is not perfect, but it will do an enormous amount of good for struggling Kentuckians and Americans across the country who need help now,\u201d McConnell said.",

        "context": "WASHINGTON/PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) -The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives voted 275-134 to meet President Donald Trump\u2019s demand for $2,000 COVID-19 relief checks on Monday, sending the measure on to an uncertain future in the Republican-controlled Senate. But even as Democrats helped secure approval for what the Republican president sought on stimulus payments, they spearheaded a House vote just a short time later to override his veto of a separate $740 billion defense policy bill. The rebuke, in Trump\u2019s final weeks in office, would be the first veto override of his presidency if seconded by the Senate this week. Trump last week threatened to block a massive pandemic aid and spending package if Congress did not boost stimulus payments from $600 to $2,000 and cut other spending. He backed down from his demands on Sunday as a possible government shutdown loomed, brought on by the fight with lawmakers. But Democratic lawmakers have long wanted much bigger relief checks and used the rare point of agreement with Trump to advance the proposal - or at least to put Republicans on record against it - in the vote on Monday, less than a month before Trump leaves office. SPENDING AND CORONAVIRUS AID PACKAGE The 275 votes for passage meant the stimulus proposal narrowly exceeded the two-thirds of votes cast needed. A total of 130 Republicans, two independents and two Democrats opposed the increased checks on Monday. Trump, who lost November\u2019s election to Democratic challenger Joe Biden but has refused to concede defeat, finally signed the $2.3 trillion package into law Sunday night after holding it up with a veiled veto threat. But he continued demanding $2,000 checks. The $2.3 trillion includes $1.4 trillion in spending to fund government agencies and $892 billion in COVID-19 relief. It is not clear how the measure to increase aid checks will fare in the Senate, where some Republican lawmakers have complained that the higher amount would add hundreds of billions of dollars to the latest relief bill. Increasing the checks would cost $464 billion, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, which prepares cost estimates for legislation before Congress. Slideshow ( 5 images ) The Senate is due to convene on Tuesday, and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said he would then seek passage of the higher checks bill in the chamber, where Republicans have the majority. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Sunday made no mention of Senate plans for such a vote, after welcoming Trump\u2019s signing of the relief bill. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who has championed higher direct payments to Americans, threatened to stop the Senate from recessing for the New Year\u2019s holiday until McConnell agrees to allow a vote on the $2,000 checks. The coronavirus pandemic has killed nearly 330,000 people in the United States and led to widespread economic hardship, with millions of families relying on unemployment benefits and COVID-19 relief funds. Global markets were buoyed after Trump approved the package. Wall Street\u2019s main indexes hit record highs on Monday as Trump\u2019s signing of the aid bill bolstered bets on an economic recovery and drove gains in financial and energy stocks. PELOSI: \u2018REPUBLICANS HAVE A CHOICE\u2019 As the floor debate was under way, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: \u201cRepublicans have a choice, vote for this legislation, or vote to deny the American people the bigger paychecks that they need.\u201d Democratic Representative Dan Kildee said: \u201cWe would have included much larger payments in the legislation had he (Trump) spoken up sooner.

            "President Donald Trump speaks at an Operation Warp Speed vaccine summit at the White House on December 8. Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images\nUS President Donald Trump signaled he will not sign the coronavirus relief bill passed by Congress unless it amends the massive spending legislation.\n\u201cSend me a suitable bill or else the next administration will have to deliver a Covid relief package and maybe that administration will be me and we will get it done,\u201d he said in a video released on Twitter.\nThe extraordinary message came after Trump largely left negotiations over the measure to lawmakers and his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. It leaves the future of the $900 billion stimulus package and its accompanying government funding measure in question.\nTrump did not explicitly threaten to veto the bill, but said he was dissatisfied with its final state.\nThe statement was filmed by the White House and was not open to the media. Reporters did not have a chance to ask the President questions. It\u2019s unclear when the message was recorded.\n\u201cI\u2019m asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000 or $4,000 per couple,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items in this legislation or to send me a suitable bill.\u201d\nThe President has in the past said he would sign the bill, and earlier Tuesday the White House publicly defended the proposal. But many of his allies have spoken out against the agreement passed by Congress.",
            "President Trump in a video posted to Twitter on Tuesday night demanded that lawmakers amend the coronavirus stimulus package they passed Monday to include $2,000 checks for individuals instead of $600 checks -- while also insisting that \u201dwasteful and unnecessary\u201d items be cut from the year-end spending package that was attached to the pandemic aid.\nThe president, meanwhile, doubled down on his baseless claims that he won the presidential election in a \u201dmagnificent landslide\u201d and attacked the two most powerful Republicans in the U.S. Senate because they've acknowledged that President-elect Biden won the election.\nTrump's broadsides against his own party, unproven election claims and 11th-hour stimulus demands after essentially being absent through the entire negotiating process continued his pattern of sowing chaos in the waning days of his presidency as he's failed to publicly accept that he will be leaving the White House in less than a month.\n\u201dI am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000, or $4,000 for a couple,\u201d Trump said in his Twitter video. \u201dI'm also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation, and to send me a suitable bill or else the next administration will have to deliver a package, and maybe that administration will be me.\u201d\nWatch:\nThe year-end funding package, often referred to as an omnibus, was combined with the coronavirus stimulus bill as Congress raced to get out of Washington, D.C., for Christmas. The funding package was previously negotiated in Congress, while lawmakers finally came to an agreement on the coronavirus aid over the weekend. Both would have had to pass anyway, but combining them allowed it to be done in one vote.\nTRUMP'S CALL FOR $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS HAILED -- BY CRITICS PELOSI, AOC, SANDERS\nSome lawmakers had voiced process objections over the fact the two were combined and derisively termed the monstrous legislation the \u201dcoronabus.\u201d Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said it \u201dshould have been divided into well over 20 bills.\u201d\nBut Trump appeared to confuse the spending package that funds the government and the coronavirus stimulus.\n\u201dA few months ago, Congress started negotiations on a new package to get urgently needed help to the American people. It's taken forever,\u201d Trump said. \u201dHowever, the bill they are now planning to send back to my desk is much different than anticipated. It really is a disgrace.\u201d\nTrump added: \u201dFor example, among the more than 5,000 pages in this bill, which nobody in Congress has read because of its length and complexity -- it's called the COVID relief bill, but it has almost nothing to do with COVID.\u201d\nIt's unclear at this point what Congress will do about Trump's demands. Trump did not issue a direct veto threat in his Tuesday video and still could sign the bill if lawmakers and their staffs don't come back -- although it is not clear if they will or not, according to congressional sources.\nFOR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF, TRUMP DEMANDS CONGRESS INCREASE DIRECT PAYMENTS TO AMERICANS\nTrump also has the potential, if he simply refuses to sign the \u201dcoronabus\u201d and Congress doesn't send him anything more, to \u201dpocket veto\u201d the legislation. That would force Congress to essentially start the legislative process all over. It would put the government at risk of a shutdown yet again, as it is currently operating on a seven-day interim spending bill.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, immediately seized on Trump's check demand to attack Republicans and demand that the direct stimulus be increased to $2,000 per individual. The House plans on Thursday to try to amend the bill via unanimous consent.\n\u201dRepublicans repeatedly refused to say what amount the President wanted for direct checks,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted. \u201dAt last, the President has agreed to $2,000 \u2014 Democrats are ready to bring this to the Floor this week by unanimous consent. Let\u2019s do it!\u201d\n\u201dI\u2019m in. Whaddya say, Mitch?\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted. \u201dLet\u2019s not get bogged down with ideological offsets and unrelated items and just DO THIS! The American people deserve it.\u201d\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office did not respond to a request for comment on what the Senate may do in light of Trump's Monday video. He and other GOP lawmakers touted the stimulus deal as a triumph on Monday and Tuesday before Trump called it a \u201ddisgrace.\u201d The White House also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this story.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP GRANTS SEVERAL HIGH-PROFILE PARDONS\nAnd the pressure on Republicans is not just from a legislative angle in Congress. Trump handed the Democratic Senate candidates in Georgia a cudgel with which to hammer their incumbent Republican opponents.\n\u201dLast night Kelly Loeffler and I left Georgia late, got up there just before midnight, we voted on this next round of COVID relief and I'm so proud to be able to bring that relief back to Georgia,\u201d Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., said in a video posted Tuesday, hours before Trump slammed lawmakers for sending the package to his desk.\nAmmar Moussa, a spokesman for Jon Ossoff, who is the Democrat challenging Perdue, shared Trump's video with his followers.\n\u201dDavid Perdue is already running ads touting a COVID relief bill he had nothing to do with,\u201d Moussa said. \u201dHere\u2019s Donald Trump ripping it apart.\u201d\n\u201dPresident Trump is as ever, erratic and all over the place, but on this point, he's right. $600 is a joke,\u201d Ossoff himself added. \u201dAnd David Perdue, my opponent, who opposed even the first round of $1,200 checks \u2013 imagine that... And now decided he wanted to cut it down to $600 bucks when people can barely feed their families through no fault of their own.\u201d\nMany Republicans were already worried that Trump's election fraud claims could depress GOP turnout for Loeffler and Perdue, although Trump has vocally backed the two senators and even traveled to Georgia to campaign for them. The campaigns for Perdue and Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., did not respond to requests for comment on the Trump video. The Georgia Senate races will decide which party controls the body for the next two years and to what extent Republicans can thwart Biden's agenda.\nIn a separate video Tuesday, Trump continued his false claims that \u201dwe won the election by a landslide, we won it big.\u201d He repeated a number of claims that have been pushed by fringe allies of his, including lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood, whose election-related lawsuits have been uniformly rejected by the courts.\nWHY HOUSE SPLIT THE CORONAVIRUS AND OMNIBUS PACKAGE INTO TWO VOTES, AND WHAT IT MAY MEAN FOR NEXT CONGRESS\nTrump concluded, \u201dWe cannot allow a completely fraudulent election to stand.\u201d\nTrump's allegations of voter fraud have been putting Republicans in a tight spot, forcing them to choose between supporting the president's unsubstantiated claims or risking his Twitter ire.\nAnd no Republicans are immune from it. In the past week, Trump has lambasted the top two Republicans in the Senate for accepting the result of the presidential election -- that Biden won.\nAfter McConnell congratulated Biden on his victory, Trump last week said in a tweet that McConnell \u201dand Republican Senators have to get tougher.\u201d\nSenate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., meanwhile, previously said that \u201dit's time for everybody to move on\u201d from the election challenges and to accept Biden's victory. Asked Monday about the prospects for success of a challenge in Congress to Biden's Electoral College victory, which Trump has endorsed, Thune said it will be \u201dgoing down like a shot dog.\u201d\nThat led Trump to declare that Thune's time in the Senate is limited.\n\u201dRepublicans in the Senate so quickly forget. Right now they would be down 8 seats without my backing them in the last Election. RINO John Thune, 'Mitch\u2019s boy', should just let it play out,\u201d Trump said in a tweet Tuesday. \u201dSouth Dakota doesn\u2019t like weakness. He will be primaried in 2022, political career over!!!\u201d\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThune's office has not publicly responded to the Trump tweet.\nTrump will leave office on Jan. 20 when Biden is inaugurated, at least somewhat easing the pressure on the GOP to back his erratic behavior. But he has already hinted that he would run for president in 2024, which could freeze the field of presidential candidates and force Republicans to continue to be accountable to Trump or else risk losing his base.\nFox News reported Tuesday that Bill Stepien, Trump's reelection campaign manager, and other top Trump campaign members are setting up a political consulting firm that will likely work with Trump as he continues to wield his influence over the GOP even after he leaves office.\nFox News' Jason Donner, Chad Pergram and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report."

        "context": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump threatened on Tuesday to not sign an $892 billion coronavirus relief bill that includes desperately needed money for individual Americans, saying it should be amended to increase the amount in the stimulus checks. U.S. government operations are being funded on a temporary basis through Dec. 28, waiting for the $1.4 trillion in federal spending for fiscal 2021 that is also part of the bill. Failure to either pass another stopgap bill or override a possible Trump veto of the legislation could result in a partial government shutdown. The threat by the outgoing Republican president, who has less than a month left in office, throws into turmoil a bipartisan effort in Congress to provide help for people whose lives have been upended by the pandemic. \u201cThe bill they are now planning to send back to my desk is much different than anticipated,\u201d Trump said in a video posted on Twitter. \u201cIt really is a disgrace.\u201d The U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate both passed the legislation overwhelmingly on Monday night. Trump said he wants Congress to increase the amount in the stimulus checks to $2,000 for individuals or $4,000 for couples, instead of the \u201cridiculously low\u201d $600 for individuals that is in the bill. Trump also complained about money provided for foreign countries, the Smithsonian Institution and fish breeding, among other spending that is in the part of the legislation to fund the U.S. government. \u201cI\u2019m also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation, and to send me a suitable bill, or else the next administration will have to deliver a COVID relief package. And maybe that administration will be me,\u201d said Trump, who has continued to push baseless claims that he won re-election in November. Trump, who will leave office on Jan. 20 when President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in, did not use the word \u201cveto\u201d in his statement. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump departs on travel to West Point, New York from the South Lawn at the White House in Washington, U.S., December 12, 2020. REUTERS/Cheriss May/File Photo The 92-6 vote in the Senate and the 359-53 vote in the House both are well over the two-thirds majority needed to override a presidential veto, though some Republicans might balk at overriding a veto if Trump used that power. A bill can be amended if congressional leadership wants to do so. If they don\u2019t, Trump\u2019s choices are to sign the bill into law, veto it, or do nothing and let it become law. If the bill is amended, doing so by Dec. 28 could be very difficult. It took months for the parties to agree to the thousands of elements in not only the coronavirus aid part, but the $1.4 trillion agreement to fund much of the U.S. government. Even if leadership wants to amend the bill, it still would have to be voted upon by the full House and Senate. Also, many Republicans might balk at the $2,000 direct payments because that would boost the cost of the bill to well over $1 trillion. Two years ago, a record-long, 35-day government shutdown was sparked when Congress sent Trump a government spending bill it thought he would support, only to see him reject it over what he said was insufficient funding for building his vaunted U.S.-Mexico border wall. Trump also said a two-year tax break for corporate meal expenses was \u201cnot enough\u201d to help struggling restaurants. The White House did not signal any objections to the legislation before it passed and gave every expectation that Trump would sign it. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was involved in the negotiations over the bill. White House officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump\u2019s intentions. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a tweet that Republicans would not say during negotiations what amount Trump wanted the stimulus checks to be. She said Democrats are ready to bring his proposal for $2,000 checks to the House floor for a vote this week. She did not address Trump\u2019s other concerns. Trump\u2019s complaints came just as the 5,500-page bill was being processed for sending to the White House for signing by the president, who is scheduled to leave on Wednesday afternoon to spend the rest of the year at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. Trump\u2019s video was taped in private at the White House, without reporters present, continuing a recent boycott of appearing at public events where he might be exposed to questions about his failed attempt to challenge the results of the Nov. 3 election.",
        "summarized_context": "President Donald Trump has threatened not to sign the coronavirus relief bill passed by Congress unless it is amended to include $2,000 checks for individuals instead of $600. In a video released on Twitter, Trump also called for the removal of \"wasteful and unnecessary\" items from the bill. The future of the $900 billion stimulus package and its accompanying government funding measure is now uncertain. Trump's demands have caused chaos and confusion, with lawmakers unsure of how to proceed. Democrats have seized on Trump's call for larger stimulus checks and plan to amend the bill to increase the amount."

            "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump signed an executive order late Thursday to block all U.S. transactions with TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent corporation, Bytedance, the latest move by the administration to force the video-sharing app to sever its ties to Beijing.\nThe order, which is likely to face legal challenges, would bar \u201cany transaction by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, with ByteDance Ltd\u201d in an effort to \u201caddress the national emergency with respect to the information and communication technology supply chain.\u201d\n\u00a9 Alex Brandon, AP President Donald Trump\nThe administration is investigating whether ByteDance is harvesting the data of millions of American users. The U.S. Navy last year urged service members to delete the app from government devices.\nThe new order bans TikTok under the National Emergencies Act and is set to take effect in 45 days, just after the Sept. 15 deadline set for Microsoft's proposed purchase of the social media platform. Any company still doing business with TikTok in 45 days is subject to sanctions, according to the order.\nRelated slideshow: News in pictures (Provided by Photo Services)\nGallery\nTrump\u2019s order stressed what he has called the privacy threat of the Chinese-owned app.\n\u201cThe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China) continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,\u201d the order said.\nTikTok which features short videos and is used by 100 million American consumers and hundreds of millions globally, has rejected claims that it sends U.S. user data to the Chinese government.\nThe threat comes at a moment of extremely frayed U.S. China relations, as the president has engaged in a months-long trade war with the country and has accused its leaders of allowing the coronavirus to spread into a pandemic. Tensions have been raised further by China's crackdown on pro-democracy efforts in Hong Kong.\nThe president first threatened to \u201dban\u201d the company in the United States late last week but softened his stance after Microsoft said it will \u201dmove quickly to pursue discussions with TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance,\u201d with a final decision expected no later than Sept. 15.\n\n\u201cI set a date of around Sept. 15, at which point it\u2019s going to be out of business,\u201d unless it surrenders Chinese ownership, Trump told reporters on Monday. \u201dBut if somebody ... buys it, that'll be interesting.\u201d\nTrump has also signaled that he expects the U.S. Treasury to receive a cut from the potential Microsoft purchase of TikTok, arguing the U.S. made the deal possible. He has not clarified how that would work or whether he has the legal authority to demand payment to the government.\nTrump signed another executive order banning transactions with the Chinese owners of messaging app WeChat, citing similar national security concerns.\n\n\u201cWeChat automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users - threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information,\u201d the order said.",
            "President Trump issued executive orders Thursday night banning the Chinese applications TikTok and WeChat, saying they pose a threat to U.S. national security.\nMr. Trump\u2019s order against TikTok, a video-sharing mobile app, bars any transactions with its Chinese parent company starting in 45 days.\n\u201cThe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People\u2019s Republic of China continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,\u201d the president told Congress in a letter.\nTikTok, a video-sharing mobile application owned by the Chinese company ByteDance Ltd., has raised concerns in Washington for capturing automatically vast swaths of information from its users. The company now must sell its U.S. operations by Sept. 15 to Microsoft Corp or another U.S. firm.\nThe president said TikTok\u2019s data collection \u201cthreatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans\u2019 personal and proprietary information \u2014 potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.\u201d\n\u201cTikTok also reportedly censors content that the Chinese Communist Party deems politically sensitive, such as content concerning protests in Hong Kong and China\u2019s treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities,\u201d the president said. \u201cTikTok may also be used for disinformation campaigns that benefit the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d\nHis order on WeChat also bars any transactions with the owner Tencent Holdings starting in 45 days.\n\u201cLike TikTok, WeChat automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users \u2014 threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans\u2019 personal and proprietary information,\u201d the president said. \u201cIn addition, WeChat captures the personal and proprietary information of Chinese nationals visiting the United States, thereby allowing the Chinese Communist Party a mechanism for keeping tabs on Chinese citizens who may be enjoying the benefits of a free society for the first time in their lives.\u201d\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.

It confirms that he lacked a good faith basis and that the subpoena amounts to harassment of the President,\u201d Trump's lawyers wrote.\nRead More",

        "context": "(Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday filed a new challenge to the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s subpoena for his tax returns, weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court said the president was not immune from state criminal probes. U.S. President Donald Trump wears a protective face mask during a tour of the Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies' Innovation Center, a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant where components for a potential coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine candidate Novavax are being developed, in Morrrisville, North Carolina, U.S., July 27, 2020. REUTERS/Carlos Barria In a second amended complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that the subpoena was \u201cwildly overbroad,\u201d and was issued in \u201cbad faith\u201d and amounts to \u201charassment.\u201d The subpoena \u201cis so sweeping that it amounts to an unguided and unlawful \u2018fishing expedition\u2019 into the President\u2019s personal and financial dealings,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote in the complaint. Trump, who is seeking re-election on Nov. 3, asked the court to declare the subpoena invalid. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance last August issued the grand jury subpoena to Trump\u2019s accounting firm, Mazars USA, demanding eight years of his business and personal returns and other documents as part of an investigation involving Trump and the Trump Organization, his family\u2019s real estate business. On July 9, the Supreme Court in a 7-2 vote rejected his argument that he was immune from state criminal probes while in the White House. The high court said, however, that Trump could challenge the subpoena on other grounds. In the newly amended complaint, Trump\u2019s lawyers say Vance is demanding documents that relate to topics beyond New York jurisdiction, and argue the subpoena was issued in bad faith because it mirrors a congressional subpoena. Vance\u2019s investigation began after reports that Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen paid pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 for her silence before the 2016 election about sexual encounters with Trump, which he has denied. Carey Dunne, general counsel for Vance, on July 16 warned U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marrero against allowing Trump to delay long enough to get beyond statutes of limitations. [L2N2EN1CW] Even if Vance prevails, grand jury secrecy rules make it unlikely Trump\u2019s financial records will become public soon. But that could change if charges are filed against other defendants.",
        "summarized_context": "President Trump has filed an amended complaint in a New York federal court, arguing that the Manhattan district attorney's subpoena for his financial records is \"wildly overbroad\" and was issued in \"bad faith.\" Trump's lawyers claim that the subpoena, which seeks eight years of tax returns and other financial records, amounts to a \"fishing expedition\" and reaches beyond the scope of the district attorney's jurisdiction. The filing comes after the Supreme Court ruled that a president does not have complete immunity from a state grand jury investigation. The Manhattan District Attorney's Office has until August 10 to respond to the new legal challenges."

The forensic lab combats cybercrime cases involving underground online marketplaces, child exploitation, intellectual property theft and other computer and online crimes. AFP HOTO/Paul J. Richards (Photo credit should read PAUL J. RICHARDS/AFP/Getty Images)\nThe US Commerce Department confirmed Sunday it has been the victim of a data breach in an attack that is believed to be linked to Russia.\n\u201dWe can confirm there has been a breach in one of our bureaus,\u201d the Commerce Department said in a statement to CNN. \u201dWe have asked CISA and the FBI to investigate, and we cannot comment further at this time.\u201d\nThe Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency also confirmed the data security incident, telling CNN in a statement, \u201dWe have been working closely with our agency partners regarding recently discovered activity on government networks.\u201d\n\u201dCISA is providing technical assistance to affected entities as they work to identify and mitigate any potential compromises,\u201d the statement continued.\nReuters was first to report on the data breach.\nThe Washington Post reported Sunday that Russian government hackers targeted Commerce as well as the Treasury Department and other government agencies, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. The paper reported the FBI is investigating and that the same Russia-linked group breached the elite cybersecurity firm FireEye, which just last week disclosed an attack compromising the so-called \u201dRed Team\u201d tools it uses to protect cybersecurity clients, including government customers.\nCNN has previously reported the Russian-affiliated group, known as APT29, as the suspected culprit behind the FireEye breach, citing a person familiar with the matter.\n\u201dIt's all related,\u201d said a source familiar with the attacks on both FireEye and those reported Sunday. Russia has maintained a steady, aggressive cyber campaign against both the US public and private sectors.\n\u201dThese sorts of attacks leveraging trusted relationships are extraordinarily difficult to detect and defend against in real-time,\u201d the person said, adding that while the Commerce and Treasury Departments are the victims that have so far been identified, \u201dthere will no doubt be more.\u201d\nLast week, the National Security Agency published an advisory warning that Russian state-sponsored actors were accessing data on protected systems and called for various government networks, including the Defense Department's, to be patched immediately.\nThe Treasury Department, the National Security Council, the FBI, National Security Agency and US Cyber Command did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.",
            "A \u201dsophisticated hacking group\u201d backed by the Russian government reportedly infiltrated the Department of Treasury's systems and stole information related to internet and telecommunications policymaking as part of a broader campaign that also hacked the Commerce Department and other government agencies.\nThe FBI is investigating the attacks and is looking into the Russian hacking group APT29, also known as Cozy Bear, as a potential culprit, according to the Washington Post. The foreign-backed hack was first reported by Reuters. An FBI spokesperson told the Washington Examiner that the bureau \u201dis aware of today's reporting and is appropriately engaged, however, we decline to comment further.\u201d\nAs a result of the hack, the National Security Council held a meeting at the White House on Sunday.\nThe Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency confirmed the incident in a statement but did not suggest who was behind the attack.\n\u201dWe have been working closely with our agency partners regarding recently discovered activity on government networks,\u201d the agency said. \u201dCISA is providing technical assistance to affected entities as they work to identify and mitigate any potential compromises.\u201d\nSolarWinds, an IT company, runs network management systems that were breached by the hackers, as first reported by the Washington Post.\n\u201dWe are aware of a potential vulnerability which if present is currently believed to be related to updates which were released between March and June 2020 to our Orion monitoring products,\u201d Kevin Thompson, the president and CEO of the company, told the Washington Examiner in a statement. \u201dWe believe that this vulnerability is the result of a highly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state. We are acting in close coordination with FireEye, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the intelligence community, and other law enforcement to investigate these matters. As such, we are limited as to what we can share at this time.\u201d\nCISA released an emergency directive to the rest of the government, aside from the Pentagon and the intelligence community, just before midnight on Sunday.\n\u201dSolarWinds Orion products \u2026 are currently being exploited by malicious actors,\u201d the statement said, adding that \u201cthis tactic permits an attacker to gain access to network traffic management systems.\u201d\nThe agency said it \u201cdetermined that this exploitation of SolarWinds products poses an unacceptable risk to Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies and requires emergency action\u201d and ordered federal agencies to \u201cforensically image system memory and/or host operating systems,\u201d analyze \u201cfor new user or service accounts,\u201d and analyze \u201dnetwork traffic for indications of compromise.\u201d The cybersecurity agency said that \u201caffected agencies shall immediately disconnect or power down SolarWinds Orion products,\u201d and federal agencies had until noon on Monday to report the existence of specific SolarWind indicators to CISA.\n\nThe cybersecurity agency said that \u201cafter (and only after) all threat actor-controlled accounts and identified persistence mechanisms have been removed,\u201d the other agencies should \u201ctreat all hosts monitored by the SolarWinds Orion monitoring software as compromised by threat actors and assume that further persistence mechanisms have been deployed.\u201d\nNSC spokesman John Ullyot said that the government is \u201daware of these reports\u201d and was \u201dtaking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to the situation.\u201d The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment.\nA Commerce Department spokesperson told the Washington Examiner that \u201dwe can confirm there has been a breach in one of our bureaus\u201d and that \u201dwe have asked CISA and the FBI to investigate, and we cannot comment further at this time.\u201d The Wall Street Journal reported that the hack of Commerce Department systems targeted the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, which advises the executive branch and the president on information policy.\nThe New York Times reported that the cyberattacks on Treasury and Commerce gave the hackers \u201cfree access to their email systems.\u201d\nAPT29 has been linked to several high-profile hacking campaigns, including attempts to steal coronavirus vaccine research. The group was also connected to a Tuesday attack on FireEye, a cybersecurity firm that works with government agencies and specializes in exposing and fighting foreign cyberattacks.\nFireEye, a $3.5 billion Silicon Valley company famous for helping governments and its large corporate clients respond to cyberattacks, announced last week that a \u201dstate-sponsored attack\u201d resulted in the cyber theft of secretive \u201cRed Team\u201d cybertools that mimic a cyber adversary\u2019s online attacks and assist clients with defending against them. The group said it was working with the FBI and Microsoft to investigate, and the New York Times reported at the time that the \u201cevidence points to Russia\u2019s intelligence agencies\u201d while the Wall Street Journal reported that \u201ca person familiar with the matter said Russia is currently seen by investigators as the most likely culprit but stressed that the investigation was continuing.\u201d\nKevin Mandia, the president of FireEye, wrote a blog post late Sunday night, saying that the company \u201cidentified a global campaign that introduces a compromise into the networks of public and private organizations through the software supply chain.\u201d He said, \u201cThis compromise is delivered through updates to a widely-used IT infrastructure management software \u2014 the Orion network monitoring product from SolarWinds.\u201d Mandia added that \u201cthe campaign demonstrates top-tier operational tradecraft and resourcing consistent with state-sponsored threat actors.\u201d\nThe FireEye leader said, \u201cWe have now identified multiple organizations where we see indications of compromise dating back to the Spring of 2020, and we are in the process of notifying those organizations.\u201d He added that his company has determined that \u201ceach of the attacks require meticulous planning and manual interaction.\u201d\n\u201cWe have been in close coordination with SolarWinds, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other key partners,\u201d Mandia said. \u201cWe believe it is critical to notify all our customers and the security community about this threat so organizations can take appropriate steps.\u201d\nIn a separate post, FireEye said it had identified hacking victims, including \u201cgovernment, consulting, technology, telecom and extractive entities in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East,\u201d and \u201cwe anticipate there are additional victims in other countries and verticals.\u201d\nMicrosoft, which is also believed to be helping with the broader investigation into the intrusions against the U.S. government, released a threat warning on Saturday about malicious behavior detected by Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which it had dubbed \u201cWin32/Solorigate.C!dha\u201d \u2014 a likely reference to the SolarWinds hack.\nCISA tweeted late Sunday night about the \u201cpublicly identified nation state backed threat actor activity.\u201d The short statement also noted that the agency was \u201caware of active exploitation of SolarWinds Orion Platform software \u2026 released between March 2020 and June 2020\u201d and CISA \u201cencourages affected organizations to read the SolarWinds and FireEye advisories for more information and FireEye\u2019s GitHub page for detection countermeasures.\u201d\nThe incident comes weeks after President Trump fired Chris Krebs, who had headed CISA. His role has not been permanently filled.\nLast week, the National Security Agency released a cybersecurity advisory warning that \u201cRussian state-sponsored malicious cyber actors are exploiting a vulnerability\u201d in products created by the California-based VMware software company, and that the vulnerability was \u201callowing the actors access to protected data and abusing federated authentication.\u201d The NSA said then that it \u201cencourages National Security System, Department of Defense, and Defense Industrial Base network administrators to prioritize mitigation of the vulnerability on affected servers.\u201d\nIf Russian culpability is definitively established for the hacks of U.S. government agencies, it would harken back to Russia\u2019s large-scale hacking of the State Department in 2014. Cyber actors affiliated with Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff, or GRU, were also named by the U.S., including in federal indictments from special counsel Robert Mueller, as responsible for the hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email systems in 2016.\nThe Washington Examiner reached out to the Treasury Department for further comment."

        "context": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hackers believed to be working for Russia have been monitoring internal email traffic at the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments, according to people familiar with the matter, adding they feared the hacks uncovered so far may be the tip of the iceberg. FILE PHOTO: A hooded man holds a laptop computer as cyber code is projected on him in this illustration picture taken on May 13, 2017. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Illustration The hack is so serious it led to a National Security Council meeting at the White House on Saturday, said one of the people familiar with the matter. U.S. officials have not said much publicly beyond the Commerce Department confirming there was a breach at one of its agencies and that they asked the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI to investigate. National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot added that they \u201care taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation.\u201d The U.S. government has not publicly identified who might be behind the hacking, but three of the people familiar with the investigation said Russia is currently believed to be responsible for the attack. Two of the people said that the breaches are connected to a broad campaign that also involved the recently disclosed hack on FireEye, a major U.S. cybersecurity company with government and commercial contracts. In a statement posted here to Facebook, the Russian foreign ministry described the allegations as another unfounded attempt by the U.S. media to blame Russia for cyberattacks against U.S. agencies. The cyber spies are believed to have gotten in by surreptitiously tampering with updates released by IT company SolarWinds, which serves government customers across the executive branch, the military, and the intelligence services, according to two people familiar with the matter. The trick - often referred to as a \u201csupply chain attack\u201d - works by hiding malicious code in the body of legitimate software updates provided to targets by third parties. In a statement released late Sunday, the Austin, Texas-based company said that updates to its monitoring software released between March and June of this year may have been subverted by what it described as a \u201chighly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state.\u201d The company declined to offer any further detail, but the diversity of SolarWind\u2019s customer base has sparked concern within the U.S. intelligence community that other government agencies may be at risk, according to four people briefed on the matter. SolarWinds says on its website that its customers include most of America\u2019s Fortune 500 companies, the top 10 U.S. telecommunications providers, all five branches of the U.S. military, the State Department, the National Security Agency, and the Office of President of the United States. \u2018HUGE CYBER ESPIONAGE CAMPAIGN\u2019 The breach presents a major challenge to the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden as officials investigate what information was stolen and try to ascertain what it will be used for. It is not uncommon for large scale cyber investigations to take months or years to complete. \u201cThis is a much bigger story than one single agency,\u201d said one of the people familiar with the matter. \u201cThis is a huge cyber espionage campaign targeting the U.S. government and its interests.\u201d Hackers broke into the NTIA\u2019s office software, Microsoft\u2019s Office 365. Staff emails at the agency were monitored by the hackers for months, sources said. A Microsoft spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did a spokesman for the Treasury Department. The hackers are \u201chighly sophisticated\u201d and have been able to trick the Microsoft platform\u2019s authentication controls, according to a person familiar with the incident, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to speak to the press. \u201cThis is a nation state,\u201d said a different person briefed on the matter. The full scope of the breach is unclear. The investigation is still its early stages and involves a range of federal agencies, including the FBI, according to three of the people familiar with the matter. A spokesperson for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said they have been \u201cworking closely with our agency partners regarding recently discovered activity on government networks. CISA is providing technical assistance to affected entities as they work to identify and mitigate any potential compromises.\u201d The FBI and U.S. National Security Agency did not respond to a request for comment. There is some indication that the email compromise at NTIA dates back to this summer, although it was only recently discovered, according to a senior U.S. official.",
        "summarized_context": "The US Commerce Department and the Department of Treasury have been targeted in a data breach believed to be linked to Russia. The FBI is investigating the attacks, which are suspected to be the work of the Russian hacking group APT29. The breach is part of a broader campaign that also targeted other government agencies. The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed the incident and is providing technical assistance to affected entities. The breach follows a recent attack on cybersecurity firm FireEye, which was also attributed to APT29."

People familiar with the matter believe the hackers are working for Russia and fear that the hacks uncovered so far may just be the beginning. The seriousness of the hack led to a National Security Council meeting at the White House. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the allegations and reminded that President Vladimir Putin had proposed agreements on cyber security with the U.S., which Washington has not responded to. Peskov suggested that blaming Russia without evidence is unwarranted."

In addition, in my assessment, there is a chance that already in the coming year there will be a peace deal with additional countries in Africa, chief among them, Sudan,\u201d Cohen told Army Radio.\nPresident Trump's joint announcement with the UAE and Israel was landmark enough on its own. The normalization marks the first between Israel and another Middle Eastern nation since President Bill Clinton helped broker the peace deal between Israel and Jordan in 1994. A single new formalization is a big deal that it is, and for other nations to join, especially as Iran grows unusually embattled, would constitute a monumental realignment of the axis of power in the Gulf.\nAnd, of course, it would undercut the entire thesis of the de facto Obama Doctrine that assumed peace in the Middle East was contingent of empowering Iran and cowering to the Hamas and Hezbollah.\nThe White House national security adviser concurs with Cohen's assessment, telling NBC News that the Trump administration has indeed been in talks with several other Middle Eastern nations. The result could look like the antithesis of Obama's goal, with Gulf nations and other north African nations joining Egypt to create an axis of peace engaged in (an extremely) slow walk toward liberalization while the alliances of terror organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah relegated to an increasingly isolated Turkey and impotent Iran. Predictions that Trump's decision to move our embassy to Jerusalem would result in mass death and violence continue to look contrary to the reality of a Middle East with peace looking more and more possible.\nThe Obama Doctrine has been disproven, and Trump's approach to the Middle East is clearly focused in the right direction.

            "According to a lengthy joint statement between the US, UAE and Israel, posted on the website of the US Embassy in Israel and tweeted by Trump, the agreement calls for the \u201dfull normalization of relations\u201d between the two Middle Eastern countries. It also calls for Israel to \u201dsuspend\u201d plans to annex the West Bank -- which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has characterized as only a \u201dtemporary postponement.\u201d\nRead the statement here:\nPresident Donald J. Trump, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, and Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the United Arab Emirates spoke today and agreed to the full normalization of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.\nThis historic diplomatic breakthrough will advance peace in the Middle East region and is a testament to the bold diplomacy and vision of the three leaders and the courage of the United Arab Emirates and Israel to chart a new path that will unlock the great potential in the region. All three countries face many common challenges and will mutually benefit from today's historic achievement.\nDelegations from Israel and the United Arab Emirates will meet in the coming weeks to sign bilateral agreements regarding investment, tourism, direct flights, security, telecommunications, technology, energy, healthcare, culture, the environment, the establishment of reciprocal embassies, and other areas of mutual benefit. Opening direct ties between two of the Middle East's most dynamic societies and advanced economies will transform the region by spurring economic growth, enhancing technological innovation, and forging closer people-to-people relations.\nAs a result of this diplomatic breakthrough and at the request of President Trump with the support of the United Arab Emirates, Israel will suspend declaring sovereignty over areas outlined in the President's Vision for Peace and focus its efforts now on expanding ties with other countries in the Arab and Muslim world. The United States, Israel and the United Arab Emirates are confident that additional diplomatic breakthroughs with other nations are possible, and will work together to achieve this goal.\nThe United Arab Emirates and Israel will immediately expand and accelerate cooperation regarding the treatment of and the development of a vaccine for the coronavirus. Working together, these efforts will help save Muslim, Jewish, and Christian lives throughout the region.\nThis normalization of relations and peaceful diplomacy will bring together two of America's most reliable and capable regional partners. Israel and the United Arab Emirates will join with the United States to launch a Strategic Agenda for the Middle East to expand diplomatic, trade, and security cooperation. Along with the United States, Israel and the United Arab Emirates share a similar outlook regarding the threats and opportunities in the region, as well as a shared commitment to promoting stability through diplomatic engagement, increased economic integration, and closer security coordination. Today's agreement will lead to better lives for the peoples of the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and the region.\nThe United States and Israel recall with gratitude the appearance of the United Arab Emirates at the White House reception held on January 28, 2020, at which President Trump presented his Vision for Peace, and express their appreciation for United Arab Emirates' related supportive statements. The parties will continue their efforts in this regard to achieve a just, comprehensive and enduring resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As set forth in the Vision for Peace, all Muslims who come in peace may visit and pray at the Al Aqsa Mosque, and Jerusalem's other holy sites should remain open for peaceful worshippers of all faiths.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu and Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan express their deep appreciation to President Trump for his dedication to peace in the region and to the pragmatic and unique approach he has taken to achieve it.",

As Congress prepares to affirm President-elect Joe Biden's victory, thousands of people have gathered to show their support for President Donald Trump and his claims of election fraud. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)\nThe US Capitol is once again secured but four people are dead -- including one woman who was shot -- after supporters of President Donald Trump breached one of the most iconic American buildings, engulfing the nation's capital in chaos after Trump urged his supporters to fight against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes that will confirm President-elect Joe Biden's win.\nShortly after 1 p.m. ET Wednesday hundreds of pro-Trump protesters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, where they tussled with officers in full riot gear, some calling the officers \u201dtraitors\u201d for doing their jobs. About 90 minutes later, police said demonstrators got into the building and the doors to the House and Senate were being locked. Shortly after, the House floor was evacuated by police. Vice President Mike Pence was also evacuated from the chamber, where he was to perform his role in the counting of electoral votes.\nAn armed standoff took place at the House front door at about 3 p.m. ET, and police officers had their guns drawn at someone who was trying to breach it. A Trump supporter was also pictured standing at the Senate dais earlier in the afternoon.\nA woman, who is yet to be identified, died after being shot in the chest on the Capitol grounds, DC police confirmed to CNN. More information on the shooting was not immediately available and a police spokesperson said additional details will come later. DC Police Chief Robert Contee said three other people died from medical emergencies during the riot.\n\u201dOne adult female and two adult males appear to have suffered from separate medical emergencies, which resulted in their deaths. Any loss of life in the District is tragic and our thoughts are with anyone impacted by their loss,\u201d Contee said at a news conference Wednesday night.\nMultiple officers have been injured with at least one transported to the hospital, multiple sources tell CNN.\nSmoke grenades were used on the Senate side of the Capitol, as police worked to clear the building of rioters. Windows on the west side of the Senate were broken, and hundreds of officers amassed on the first floor of the building.\nThe Senate floor was cleared of rioters as of 3:30 p.m. ET, and an officer told CNN that they successfully squeezed them away from the Senate wing of the building and toward the Rotunda. The protesters were removed through the east and west doors of the Capitol. At least 52 people were arrested as of 9:30 p.m. ET Wednesday in Washington.\nThe US Capitol Police worked to secure the second floor of the Capitol first, and were seen just before 5 p.m. ET pushing demonstrators off the steps on the east side of the building. With about 30 minutes to go before Washington's 6 p.m. ET curfew, Washington police amassed in a long line to push the mob back from the Capitol grounds.\nIt took until roughly 5:40 p.m. ET for the building to once again be secured, according to the sergeant-at-arms.\nThe stunning display of insurrection was the first time the US Capitol had been overrun since the British attacked and burned the building in August of 1814, during the War of 1812, according to Samuel Holliday, director of scholarship and operations with the US Capitol Historical Society.\nThe shocking scene was met with less police force than many of the Black Lives Matter protests that rolled across the country in the wake of George Floyd's killing at the hands of Minneapolis police officers last year. While federal police attacked peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square outside the White House over the summer, clearing the way for Trump to take a photo in front of a nearby church at the time, protesters on Wednesday were able to overrun Capitol police and infiltrate the country's legislative chambers.\n\u00a9 Jose Luis Magana/AP Supporters of President Donald Trump climb the west wall of the the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\nAn afternoon of chaos\nThe protesters first breached exterior security barriers, and video footage showed protesters gathering and some clashing with police near the Capitol building. CNN's team on the ground saw a number of protesters trying to move up the side of the Capitol building. Several loud flash bangs were heard as well.\nProtesters could be seen pushing against metal fences and police used the fences to push protesters back, while other officers reached over the top to club people trying to cross their lines.\n\u00a9 John Minchillo/AP Police keep a watch on demonstrators who tried to break through a police barrier, Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, at the Capitol in Washington.

In some instances officers could be seen deploying pepper spray. Tear gas was deployed, but it's not clear whether by protesters or police, and people wiped tears from their eyes while coughing.\nAfter the building was breached, the Capitol police officer in the House chamber told lawmakers that they may need to duck under their chairs and informed lawmakers that protesters were in the building's Rotunda. Lots of House members were seen wearing gas masks as they moved between Capitol buildings. Members were calling family to say they were OK.\nCongressional leaders were being evacuated from the Capitol complex just before 5 p.m. ET and were set to be taken to Fort McNair, a nearby Army base in Washington, according to a federal law enforcement official.\nTrump has directed the National Guard to Washington along with \u201dother federal protective services,\u201d according to White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. The entire DC National Guard has been activated by the Department of Defense, according to the Pentagon.\n\u201dThe D.C. Guard has been mobilized to provide support to federal law enforcement in the District,\u201d said Jonathan Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesman. \u201dActing Secretary Miller has been in contact with Congressional leadership, and Secretary McCarthy has been working with the D.C. government. The law enforcement response will be led by the Department of Justice.\u201d\nThe official said DC National Guard was not anticipating to be used to protect federal facilities, and the Trump administration had decided earlier this week that would be the task of civilian law enforcement, the official said.\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a citywide curfew from 6 p.m. ET on Wednesday until 6 a.m. ET Thursday.\nLawmakers return to the Capitol\nLawmakers began returning to the Capitol after the building was secured and made it clear that they intended to resume their intended business -- namely, confirming Biden's win over Trump by counting the votes in the Electoral College.\nProceedings resumed at about 8 p.m. ET with Pence -- who never left the Capitol, according to his press secretary -- bringing the Senate session back into order.\n\u201dLet's get back to work,\u201d he said.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement earlier Wednesday evening that congressional leadership wanted to continue with the joint session Wednesday night.\n\u201dToday, a shameful assault was made on our democracy. It was anointed at the highest level of government. It cannot, however, deter us from our responsibility to validate the election of Joe Biden,\u201d Pelosi wrote.\n\u201dTo that end, in consultation with Leader Hoyer and Whip Clyburn and after calls to the Pentagon, the Justice Department and the Vice President, we have decided we should proceed tonight at the Capitol once it is cleared for use. Leader Hoyer will be sending out more guidance later today.\u201d\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor that the \u201dUnited States Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats.\u201d\nIt took until deep in the early hours of Thursday morning, but Congress eventually counted and certified Biden's election win.\nTrump tells supporters to go home, eventually\nTrump finally called on his supporters to \u201dgo home\u201d hours after the riot started, but spent a large amount of time in the one-minute video lamenting and lying about his election loss.\nIn one stunning line, Trump told the mob to \u201dgo home,\u201d but added, \u201dWe love you. You are very special.\u201d\nTrump struck a sympathetic tone to the rioters he himself unleashed, saying, \u201dI know your pain, I know you're hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it. Especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace.\u201d\nHowever, later on in the evening Trump justified the mob's actions and praised them.\n\u201dThese are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!\u201d he said, in a tweet that was later deleted by Twitter.\nOthers inside the President's orbit tweeted their calls for calm as the mob repeatedly attempted to take over the building.\nDonald Trump Jr., the President's son, said that his supporters who mobbed the Capitol were \u201dwrong and not who we are.\u201d\n\u201dBe peaceful and use your 1st Amendment rights, but don't start acting like the other side. We have a country to save and this doesn't help anyone,\u201d he tweeted.\nMultiple bombs detonated safely\nFederal and local law enforcement responded to reports of possible pipe bombs in multiple locations in Washington, DC, according to a federal law enforcement official.\nA pipe bomb was found at the Republican National Committee's headquarters, a RNC official told CNN. The device was found on the ground outside, along the wall of the headquarters. It was safely detonated by the police, the RNC official said.\nAt least two suspected pipe bombs were rendered safe by law enforcement -- the one at the building that houses RNC offices and one in the US Capitol complex, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. The official said these were real explosive devices and they were detonated safely.\nThe Democratic National Committee was also evacuated after a suspicious package was being investigated nearby, a Democratic source familiar with the matter told CNN. The party had preemptively closed the building ahead of the protests, the source said, but a few security and essential personnel were evacuated.\nNear the scene where one of the pipe bombs was found Wednesday, police detained a suspect and found a vehicle with a rifle and as many as 10 Molotov cocktails, according to a federal law enforcement official. Investigators are working to determine whether there's a connection to the bombs found earlier.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Wednesday.",
            "The U.S. Capitol has been locked down after pro-Trump protesters broke into the building following an incendiary speech from the president in which he vowed never to concede defeat and called on his supporters to march on Congress.\n\u201cWe will never give up,\u201d President Trump told a rapturous reception from a stage in Washington, D.C. \u201cWe will never concede.\u201d\nAfter the defiant speech, thousands of rallygoers who had arrived in Washington to contest the results of the presidential election swarmed the outside of the Capitol, breaking past U.S. Capitol Police and metal fencing.\nThe Senate and House were adjourned, with leaders rushed off the floor by their security details as the groups breached several layers of security and gained access to the Capitol chambers. Both chambers had only just broken off to debate the election results, starting with Arizona, when the chaos began to unfold.\nTrump supporters try to break through a police barrier, Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, at the Capitol in Washington.

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez) Julio Cortez/AP\nStaff inside the building have been ordered to shelter in place. Two adjacent House office buildings were evacuated through underground tunnels.\nPictures emerged from inside the Senate showing a protester raising a defiant fist from the seat Vice President Mike Pence had occupied only moments before.

        "context": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump cannot block a prosecutor\u2019s subpoena for eight years of his tax returns, a federal judge ruled on Thursday, in the latest setback in the U.S. president\u2019s longstanding effort to keep his finances under wraps. U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan rejected Trump\u2019s claims that the grand jury subpoena from Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance to the president\u2019s accounting firm Mazars USA was \u201cwildly overbroad\u201d and issued in bad faith. In a 103-page decision, Marrero also said letting Trump block the subpoena, which was issued last August, would amount to an \u201cundue expansion\u201d of presidential immunity. \u201cJustice requires an end to this controversy,\u201d Marrero wrote. Trump quickly appealed the decision and filed an emergency motion to delay turning over his tax returns, saying enforcing the subpoena would cause him irreparable harm by disclosing his \u201cprivate, confidential information.\u201d The litigation and grand jury secrecy rules make it unlikely Trump\u2019s financial records will become public before Nov. 3, when the president is seeking reelection. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said the case will likely head back to the Supreme Court, which on July 9 rejected his earlier argument he was immune from state criminal probes while in office. FILE PHOTO: Demonstrators gestures as they march past Trump Tower while protesting through Manhattan demanding U.S. President Donald Trump release his tax returns, U.S., April 15, 2017. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson -/File Photo The Supreme Court said the Republican president could still challenge the subpoena on other grounds. Marrero had also ruled last October that Vance, a Democrat, could enforce the subpoena. \u201cThis is a continuation of the most disgusting witch hunt in the history of our country,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cThis is the ultimate fishing expedition.\u201d A spokesman for Vance declined to comment. Trump has long fought efforts by lawmakers and prosecutors to obtain those records, and by withholding his tax returns has departed from the decades-long practice of his predecessors. The subpoena is related to Vance\u2019s criminal probe into Trump and his Trump Organization. In a court filing this month, Vance suggested the subpoena was related to \u201cpossibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization,\u201d including alleged insurance and bank fraud. Marrero accepted Vance\u2019s argument that letting Trump delay the subpoena\u2019s enforcement would effectively give the president \u201cabsolute temporary immunity\u201d from the probe while in the White House.

REUTERS/Joe Penney/File Photo Unless enforcing the subpoena would affect his constitutional duties, \u201cthe President is entitled to claim no greater shield from judicial process than any other person,\u201d Marrero wrote. Vance\u2019s probe began after reports that Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen paid pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to buy her silence before the 2016 election about claimed sexual encounters with Trump, which he has denied. The case is Trump v Vance et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-08694.",
        "summarized_context": "A federal judge has dismissed President Trump's attempt to block a subpoena for his tax records from Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr. The subpoena is part of an investigation into hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels before Trump's 2016 presidential win. The judge rejected Trump's arguments that the subpoena was issued in bad faith and is too broad. Trump's legal team has already stated that they will appeal the dismissal. The ruling comes after the Supreme Court rejected Trump's claims of absolute immunity from state criminal subpoenas, but allowed him to object to the subpoena on alternative grounds."

            "\u00a9 Provided by NBC News\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Congress hit a new stumbling block that prevented leaders from approving a coronavirus aid deal on Friday, as lawmakers raced to avert a government shutdown at midnight.\nThe House voted 320-60 to pass a two-day funding extension, sending it to the Senate, which quickly approved it by a voice vote.\nPresident Donald Trump signed the stopgap bill Friday night, setting up a new Sunday midnight deadline and give negotiators the weekend to sort out their differences on Covid relief.\n\u201dAlas, we are not there yet,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., calling the bill an effort to prevent a \u201dpointless lapse\u201d in funding while negotiations continued.\nCongressional leaders settled on a $900 billion framework midweek that was expected to include a $300 federal unemployment bonus, a new round of direct payments, small business funding and money to distribute Covid-19 vaccines.\nBut a new roadblock emerged as Democrats on Friday accused Republicans, led by Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, of seeking to hamstring the incoming Biden administration by cutting off Federal Reserve emergency lending facilities created by the CARES Act to protect the fragile economy.\nDemocrats want to extend that authority into the new year, describing it as an important tool to respond to an economic crisis.\nA senior Democratic aide said \u201dan agreement was in sight to deliver aid to the American people until Sen. Toomey and Republicans inserted an eleventh-hour purely political, unrelated provision to tie Biden\u2019s hands and risk throwing the economy into a tailspin.\u201d\nToomey called the issue his \u201dtop priority\u201d in a phone call with reporters, arguing that the Fed lending programs were designed to be \u201dtemporary\u201d and \u201dcease operations no later than the end of 2020.\u201d\n\u201dWe were in a very, very dangerous moment with respect to financial markets that were not functioning. And so these programs were stood up to revive these private markets and they were remarkably successful in that purpose,\u201d he said, describing his stance as \u201da Republican Senate consensus position.\u201d\nDemocrats say the language sought by Toomey is overly broad and restrictive.\n\u201dAfter weeks of refusing to acknowledge Biden's victory, some Republicans have now decided that sabotaging his presidency is more important than helping our economy recover by insisting that any Covid relief legislation also restrict the ability of the Federal Reserve and the new Administration to help states, cities, and American businesses next year,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said in a statement.\nEarlier Friday, McConnell, R-Ky., sounded upbeat.\n\u201dI am even more optimistic now than I was last night that a bipartisan, bicameral framework for a major rescue package is close at hand,\u201d McConnell said. \u201dLike I\u2019ve said, the Senate will be right here until an agreement is passed, whenever that may be.\u201d\nDownload the NBC News app for breaking news and politics\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and McConnell each said this week they planned to combine a Covid-19 relief package with a must-pass $1.4 trillion funding bill that appropriators have negotiated in recent weeks.\nThe Toomey language continued to be a hurdle into Friday afternoon.\nPelosi and McConnell spoke around 1 p.m. and agreed that staff should wrap up the agreement before 5 p.m., according to two sources familiar with the matter.\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., adjourned the chamber until 5 p.m., and when a deal still had not materialized, Democrats went ahead and put the two-day bill up for a vote.\nHoyer adjourned the House until Sunday at noon, making clear there would be no votes on Saturday even if a Covid relief deal is reached quickly.\nThe government funding bill is ready to pass, aides close to the talks said. The holdup is Covid relief.\nSenate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., said Friday that lawmakers are \u201danxious to get this done.\u201d\n\u201dThere\u2019s some always last minute stuff that pops up. But it's coming together. It's just taking time,\u201d Thune told reporters, adding that Fed lending authority remains a hurdle.\n\u201dWe have a lot of our members who believe that was for a temporary time that needs to be ended,\u201d he said. \u201dAnd the Dems see it differently. I hope we can find a way to finesse that and get a deal.\u201d",
            "President Trump signed a spending bill Friday night that will keep the government funded until Sunday at midnight.\nThe legislation, which passed through the House and the Senate earlier on Friday evening, will provide Republican and Democratic leaders additional time to hammer out final differences in a coronavirus aid package they plan to bundle with 2021 government spending legislation.\nSen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, withdrew his objection to the bill after warning he would not agree to a final government funding bill until it is paired with the coronavirus bill.\n\u201dLet us get this package passed,\u201d Sanders said. \u201dLet us make certain we have direct payments to families.\u201d\nSen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, earlier said he would object to fast passage of the bill unless virus aid negotiators assure him a new round of stimulus checks are included in a virus aid package, but he let the stopgap bill pass without trying to block it.\nHawley is seeking $1,200 checks for some individuals and families, while the deal likely includes $700 checks.\nSanders, who has joined Hawley in seeking the stimulus checks, told reporters in the Capitol he\u2019s still seeking at least $1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for couples, and $500 for children."

Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would fit with her long history of anti-social behavior,\u201d Farmer wrote.\nMaxwell denies committing any crimes.\nJudge Alison Nathan rejected Maxwell's first bid for bail after she was arrested in July on charges that she recruited and groomed several underage girls who later were abused by the late money manager Epstein, a former boyfriend of hers.\nNathan at the time said she represented an extreme flight risk because of her holding citizenship in France and Britain and her significant wealth.\nIn her new bail request, Maxwell asked to be released on a bail package that would be secured by $22.5 million personal recognizance bond, equivalent to the value of her and her husband's declared assets, and millions more pledged from seven relatives and close friends.\nMaxwell has proposed having armed guards ensure that she stays in a New York City residence and that she be monitored with an electronic device.\n\u201dMs. Maxwell vehemently maintains her innocence and is committed to defending herself,\u201d her lawyers wrote.\n\u201dShe wants nothing more than to remain in this country to fight the allegations against her, which are based on the uncorroborated testimony of a handful of witnesses about events that took place over 25 years ago.\u201d\nProsecutors in their filing Friday said that Maxwell's new bail request largely \u201drehashes\u201d arguments she made in July when her first bail application was rejected.\nAnd prosecutors said her offer to effectively waive extradition from France in the event that she skipped bail was not worth any weight because the French Ministry of Justice has reiterated to prosecutors that the nation does not extradite its citizens for criminal prosecution.\nThe filing also noted that while Maxwell's bail motion \u201dnow claims that her marriage would keep in her the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to Pretrial Services at the time of her arrest,\u201d when she said she was \u201d'in the process of divorcing her husband.'\u201d\n\u201dAccordingly, the defendant's foreign ties, wealth, and skill at avoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of detention,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\nEpstein, 66, died in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail from what officials have ruled was a suicide by hanging.

        "context": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. prosecutors on Friday said Ghislaine Maxwell, the former associate of Jeffrey Epstein charged with helping enable his sexual abuses, should remain in jail, and urged a federal judge to reject her proposed $28.5 million bail package. FILE PHOTO: Charges are announced against Ghislaine Maxwell for her role in the sexual exploitation and abuse of minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein in New York City, New York, U.S., July 2, 2020. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo In a filing with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, prosecutors said Maxwell has essentially rehashed previously rejected arguments for bail, and that she remains an \u201cextreme flight risk\u201d from \u201cincredibly serious\u201d charges. \u201cNothing in the renewed bail application alters the analysis that led this court to conclude that the defendant \u2018poses a substantial actual risk of flight,\u2019 and that no combination of conditions could assure her appearance,\u201d prosecutors said. Maxwell, 58, has been living in a Brooklyn jail since July, when she pleaded not guilty to helping Epstein recruit and groom underage girls for sex in the mid-1990s, and not guilty to perjury for having denied involvement under oath. She has proposed living with electronic monitoring in a New York City residence, and under 24-hour guard to ensure she remains safe and does not flee. Maxwell faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted at her scheduled July 2021 trial. U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan, who rejected a $5 million bail package for Maxwell in July, will consider her latest application. Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell\u2019s bail application said she \u201cvehemently maintains her innocence\u201d against allegations she assisted Epstein, based on uncorroborated testimony about events occurring more than 25 years ago. But prosecutors said new details about Maxwell\u2019s finances - details she would have known when first seeking bail - did not bolster her case. They said Maxwell\u2019s having moved most of her assets to her husband showed her ability to \u201chide her true wealth,\u201d whose size demonstrated she could \u201cabsolutely afford\u201d to flee. Prosecutors also said Maxwell\u2019s pledge to waive extradition from the United Kingdom and France, where she has citizenships, was worthless because those countries\u2019 would not allow it. Maxwell proposed posting a $22.5 million bond, representing all assets belonging to her and her husband, secured by $8.5 million of property and cash. The remaining bail would be posted by friends, family and a security specialist. \u201cRelease to the equivalent of a \u2018privately funded jail\u2019 is not warranted here,\u201d prosecutors said. Authorities arrested Maxwell on July 2 at her New Hampshire home, which prosecutors said she used as a hideout. Her husband, whose name was redacted from court papers, has said Maxwell moved there to protect her safety and escape the media frenzy, not to elude capture.",
        "summarized_context": "Federal prosecutors have urged a judge to reject Ghislaine Maxwell's new bail request, stating that there are no conditions that can ensure she will not flee to avoid trial for allegedly abetting Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of children. Prosecutors argue that Maxwell poses an extreme flight risk due to her extensive financial resources, foreign ties, and ability to live in hiding. Maxwell's first bid for bail was rejected in July, and prosecutors argue that her new bail request largely rehashes previous arguments. Maxwell has proposed a bail package of $28.5 million and has denied committing any crimes."

            "WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses drew swift blowback Thursday from both parties in Congress, and lawmakers turned to unprecedented steps to ensure he can\u2019t ignore the vote of the people. Amid the uproar, Trump said anew he\u2019s not sure the election will be \u201chonest.\u201d\nCongressional leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, rejected Trump\u2019s assertion that he\u2019ll \u201csee what happens\u201d before agreeing to any election outcome.\nMany other lawmakers \u2014 including from Trump\u2019s own Republican Party \u2014 vowed to make sure voters\u2019 wishes are followed ahead of Inauguration Day in January. And some Democrats were taking action, including formally asking Trump\u2019s defense secretary, homeland security adviser and attorney general to declare they\u2019ll support the Nov. 3 results, whoever wins.\nAsked as he departed the White House for a campaign rally if the election is only legitimate if he is the winner, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\nThe president said he wants to \u201cmake sure the election is honest, and I\u2019m not sure that it can be.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s attacks on the upcoming vote \u2014 almost without modern precedent in the U.S. \u2014 are hitting amid the tumult of the campaign, as partisan tensions rage and more Americans than ever are planning to vote by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nIt\u2019s not the first time he has sowed doubts about the voting process. But his increased questioning before any result is setting off alarms ahead of an Election Day like no other. Even without signs of illegality, results could be delayed because of the pandemic, leaving the nation exposed to groups or foreign countries seeking to provoke discord.\nMcConnell, the GOP Senate leader, said in a tweet, \u201cThe winner of the November 3rd election will be inaugurated on January 20th.\u201d He said, \u201cThere will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792.\u201d\nSaid Pelosi, \u201cCalm down, Mr. President.\u201d\n\u201cYou are in the United States of America. It is a democracy,\u201d she said, reminding Trump this is not North Korea, Russia or other countries with strongman leaders he admires. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you just try for a moment to honor our oath of office to the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\nTrump is fanning the uncertainty as he floats theories the election may be \u201crigged\u201d if he loses, echoing warnings he made ahead of the 2016 voting - even though past elections have not shown substantial evidence of fraud from mail-in voting.\nDuring a Wednesday news conference, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to see what happens,\u201d responding to a question about committing to the results. \u201cYou know that I\u2019ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots, and the ballots are a disaster.\u201d\nReaction to his comment was strong from Capitol Hill - from both parties.\nLindsey Graham, a Trump ally and the GOP chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Thursday: \u201cIf Republicans lose we will accept the result. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of Joe Biden, I will accept that result.\nRep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a member of the House GOP leadership, tweeted: \u201cThe peaceful transfer of power is enshrined in our Constitution and fundamental to the survival of our Republic. America\u2019s leaders swear an oath to the Constitution. We will uphold that oath.\u201d\nJoe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, was incredulous, \u201cWhat country are we in?\u201d he said late Wednesday of Trump\u2019s comment. \u201cLook, he says the most irrational things. I don\u2019t know what to say about it. But it doesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d\nOn Capitol Hill, Trump\u2019s possible refusal to accept the election results has been discussed privately for weeks as lawmakers consider options. One senator said recently it was the biggest topic of private discussions.\nTwo House Democrats, Reps. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan - both members of the Armed Services Committee - are formally asking members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet to go on record and commit to upholding the Constitution and peaceful transition.\nGen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, responded in a letter to the lawmakers last month that he sees \u201cno role\u201d for the military to intervene in a disputed election.\nBut Defense Secretary Mark Esper declined to respond to the lawmakers\u2019 questions. Similar queries have been sent to Attorney General William Barr and acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf. They have yet to respond.\n\u201cThe president can\u2019t successfully refuse to accept the results of the election without a number of very senior officials aiding him,\u201d said Slotkin, a former CIA analyst.\nSherill, a former Navy pilot, said peaceful transition \u201creally relies a lot on the Cabinet officers turning over their departments to the next administration.\u201d She told The Associated Press recently she wants to hear from \u201call of them.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Republicans are rushing to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court created by Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death, partly to ensure a Trump-friendly court majority to resolve any post-election lawsuits by their party or Trump himself.\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz is among leading Republicans pushing the importance of the court\u2019s role. And Graham suggested on Fox that the Supreme Court could end up all but declaring the winner.\nDemocrats object strongly.\n\u201cHe wants to be named president for life?\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., exclaimed at the Capitol. That\u2019s how a \u201cdictator\u201d operates, she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how a democracy works.\u201d\nEarlier Thursday, the White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany sought to clarify Trump\u2019s words, saying he \u201cwill accept the results of a free and fair election.\u201d\nBut the press secretary added that Trump wants to \u201cget rid of mass, mail-out voting.\u201d\nThe president, who uses mail-in voting himself, has tried to distinguish between states that automatically send ballots to all registered voters and those, like Florida, that send only to voters who request them. Five states that routinely send mail ballots to all voters have seen no significant fraud.\nOf the nine states with universal ballots this year, only Nevada is a battleground, and likely pivotal only in a total national presidential deadlock.\nBefore the 2016 election, much as now, Trump refused to commit to accepting the results during the summer.\n\u201cI have to see,\u201d Trump said two months ago on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to just say yes. I\u2019m not going to say no, and I didn\u2019t last time either.\u201d\n___\nMadhani reported from Chicago.

Trump declined on Wednesday to embrace a peaceful transfer in response to a reporter\u2019s question and said he expected his election battle with Democrat Joe Biden to be settled by the Supreme Court. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Trump said he did not know that an \u201chonest\u201d election could be held on Nov. 3 \u201cwith this whole situation, unsolicited ballots.\u201d The Republican president\u2019s rhetoric on Wednesday, which largely referred to voting by mail, set off a fury that prompted several Republicans in Congress to distance themselves from Trump. Despite four years of incendiary statements by Trump, members of his own party have been loath to criticize him, as many feared political retribution. \u201cThe winner of the November 3rd election will be inaugurated on January 20th. There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792,\u201d McConnell wrote in a morning tweet. Like other Republicans, McConnell did not directly criticize Trump. By midday, with the controversy raging, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told a news briefing: \u201cThe president will accept the results of a free and fair election.\u201d But for months, Trump has cast November\u2019s election as being rigged and repeatedly attacked Democrats for promoting widespread use of mail-in ballots for voters who do not want to risk contracting the deadly COVID-19 virus by casting their ballots at potentially crowded polling centers. FILE PHOTO: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) speaks to the media after the Republican policy luncheon on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 22, 2020. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo In an interview on Fox News Radio, Trump called mail-in ballots \u201ca horror show,\u201d despite studies showing no significant problems with that method of voting over the years. Michael Waldman, president of New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice, said voting arrangements were steadily advancing. In an interview with Reuters Television, he added: \u201cThe system is not broken. States are actually improving their voting rules day by day.\u201d Democrats accused Trump of threatening American democracy and further politicizing his upcoming choice to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg by suggesting the yet-to-be named nominee would have a role in the election\u2019s outcome. Some of McConnell\u2019s fellow Republicans joined the effort to quell election fears, including Senators Marco Rubio and Mitt Romney and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who told reporters: \u201cIt will be a smooth transition regardless of the outcome.\u201d Trump, who trails Biden in national opinion polls, has long sought to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election, asserting without evidence that mail-in voting would be rife with fraud. \u201cPresident Trump, you are not a dictator and America will not permit you to be one,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, calling him \u201cthe gravest threat\u201d to U.S. democracy. Senator Bernie Sanders, who lost to Biden in the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominating race, called for an independent commission to oversee the upcoming election. Democratic House of Representative Speaker Nancy Pelosi cautioned against panicking over the remarks of a president who she said admires autocratic leaders. At a news conference, she urged Americans to cast their ballots and admonished Trump: \u201cYou are not in North Korea, you are not in Turkey, you are not in Russia.\u201d COURT CHALLENGES If November\u2019s election is close, Trump could contest the results in federal courts in hopes of being awarded enough Electoral College votes to retain the White House, according to political analysts. Only one U.S. presidential election, the 2000 contest between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore, has had its outcome determined by the Supreme Court. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally who will play a significant role in whether Trump\u2019s upcoming Supreme Court nominee will be confirmed, said there could be litigation over the presidential election. \u201cThe (Supreme) Court will decide and if the Republicans lose, we will accept that result,\u201d Graham told Fox News. \u201cBut we need a full court.\u201d If Trump nominates a conservative to serve on the Supreme Court, as expected, and the Republican-controlled Senate confirms the nominee, it will have six justices considered to be conservative and three viewed as liberals.",

The Senate unanimously passed a resolution reaffirming support for a peaceful transition of power, and FBI Director Christopher Wray stated that there is no evidence of an organized voter fraud effort that could change the election results.

            "President-elect Joe Biden speaks at a drive-in rally for Georgia Democratic candidates for US Senate Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, Tuesday, December 15, in Atlanta. Patrick Semansky/AP\nPresident-elect Joe Biden traveled to Georgia on Tuesday to campaign for Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, the two Democrats who are challenging incumbent Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in a pair of January runoff races that will determine which party controls the US Senate.\n\u201dThey'll actually fight for you, represent you, stand up for you,\u201d Biden said of Ossoff and Warnock.\nBiden thanked voters in Georgia for turning out to vote in last month\u2019s presidential election. The President-elect became the first Democrat to win Georgia in 28 years. The last Democrat to win the state was Bill Clinton in 1992.\n\u201cThank you for standing strong to make sure your voices were heard, your votes were counted, and counted, and counted again,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m starting to feel like I won Georgia three times.\u201d Earlier this month, Georgia recertified its presidential election results, and again found Biden as the winner following three counts of ballots.\n\u201cI think all of you just taught Donald Trump a lesson: In this election, Georgia wasn\u2019t going to be bullied. Georgia wasn\u2019t going to be silenced, Georgia certainly wasn\u2019t going to stand by and let Donald Trump or the state of Texas or anyone else come in here and toss out your votes,\u201d Biden said.\nLast week, the Supreme Court rejected a bid from Texas\u2019 attorney general, which was supported by President Trump, to block the ballots of millions of voters in battleground states that went in favor of Biden. The lawsuit, brought by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a staunch Trump ally, sought to sue Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and Wisconsin \u2014 which all went for Biden \u2014 and invalidate their election results.\n\u201dYou know who did nothing while Trump, Texas and others were trying to wipe out every single one of the almost five million votes you had cast here in Georgia in November? Your two Republican senators,\u201d Biden said, slamming Perdue and Loeffler.\n\u201dThey stood by,\u201d Biden continued. \u201dIn fact, your two Republican senators fully embraced what Texas was telling the Supreme Court. They fully embraced nullifying nearly five million Georgia votes. You might want to remember that come Jan. 5.\u201d\nBiden also praised former Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who has devoted years to expanding the electorate and boosting turnout in the state, which had been reliably red for decades.\n\u201cIs there anyone in America who has done more to protect the right to vote in this election, is there anyone who\u2019s done more to make sure the voice of every Georgian is heard? I don\u2019t think so. Stacey Abrams, you\u2019re a hero,\u201d Biden said.\nWatch here:",
            "Democrats Project Confidence in Georgia Senate Runoff Victories as Biden Heads to State\nDemocratic U.S. Senate candidates on Monday projected confidence they\u2019ll emerge victorious in the upcoming runoff elections, as they prepare to campaign with Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get to Washington, D.C. as one of the next two United States senators from the state of Georgia,\u201d Raphael Warnock, a pastor who is one of the candidates, told a rally in Atlanta.\n\u201cWhen we win these two U.S. Senate races, we will pass a new voting rights act and a new civil rights act to secure equal justice under the law for all of us, regardless of race, and regardless of class,\u201d Jon Ossoff, the other candidate, added later.\nIn twin runoffs that have attracted nationwide attention, Warnock is facing Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) for an abbreviated term, while Ossoff is seeking to unseat Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.).\nNo candidates in either race won a majority of the vote in November, triggering the runoffs.\nLoeffler and Warnock emerged from a free-for-all election to finish the term of Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), who retired last year due to poor health. Loeffler, a businesswoman, was appointed to fill the seat until the presidential election by Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp.\nPerdue, a businessman vying for a second term, beat Ossoff, a filmmaker, by over 88,000 votes. Both Republicans have also said they believe they will win.\nVice President Mike Pence and Sen. David Purdue (R-Ga.) wave to the crowd during a rally in August, Ga., on Dec. 10, 2020. (Jessica McGowan/Getty Images)\nThe races could determine which party controls the Senate. If Republicans win just one, or lose both but keep the White House, they\u2019ll maintain control. Vice presidents can cast tiebreaking votes in the upper congressional chamber.\nBiden is headed to Georgia for the first time in the post-election era to campaign with Ossoff and Warnock. They will meet in Atlanta for an event.\nTrump went to Georgia on Dec. 5 while Vice President Mike Pence has campaigned with the Republican senators multiple times since the election.\nJust over 1.2 million voters requested mail ballots for the runoffs, according to state officials, showing how much interest the runoffs are attracting. Another is the amount of outside money that\u2019s poured into the state.\nEarly in-person voting started Monday and counties have accepted over 261,000 mail-in ballots so far.\n\u201cSo far, we don\u2019t have any reports of any mechanical issues or issues at the polling locations. We\u2019ve heard of no real line issues, which is a little bit different than we saw at the election in November on the first day,\u201d Gabriel Sterling, Georgia\u2019s voting system implementation manager, told reporters at a press conference.\nAlso on Monday, a Democratic official in the state warned that there\u2019s usually lower turnout in runoff elections compared to presidential ones.\n\u201cThis election is not a continuation of what happened in November. It\u2019s a complete reset. It\u2019ll have a different character. It\u2019ll have lower turnout, most likely,\u201d Cobb County Democratic Party chairwoman Jacquelyn Bettadapur told CBSN\u2019s \u201cRed & Blue.\u201d\n\u201cWe always see lower turnouts in runoff elections and in special elections,\u201d she added. \u201cWe are primarily interested in just turning out any Democrat who voted in November. That\u2019s our target audience, expecting that we will have closer to 50 percent turnout than the 70 percent turnout we had overall in November.\u201d"

        "context": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 President-elect Joe Biden told Georgia voters on Tuesday they must deliver two Democratic Senate runoffs victories in January so his administration can forcefully confront the coronavirus pandemic and other national challenges. Fresh off the Electoral College affirming his victory, Biden campaigned alongside Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock as they try to unseat Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in Jan. 5 runoff elections that will determine which party controls the Senate. The president-elect, who won Georgia in November, warned that Republican victories would leave him to face the kind of GOP obstruction that hampered former President Barack Obama for most of his two terms. ADVERTISEMENT \u201cWe can get so much done, so much that can make the lives of the people of Georgia and the whole country so much better,\u201d Biden said at a drive-in rally outside downtown Atlanta on the second day of early voting. \u201cAnd we need senators who are willing to do it, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d Biden criticized Perdue and Loeffler as \u201croadblocks\u201d for not supporting a sweeping new economic aid package as the coronavirus pandemic surges. In contrast, he said Ossoff and Warnock would \u201cfight for progress and not just get in the way.\u201d \u201cAre you ready to vote for two United States senators who know how to say the word \u2018yes\u2019 and not just \u2018no\u2019?\u201d Biden said as supporters gathered in the railroad yard honked their horns. Hours earlier in Washington, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged for the first time that Biden had defeated President Donald Trump after spending weeks muted about the president\u2019s false claims that Biden stole the election through widespread voter fraud. In fact, elections officials across the country, including some Georgia Republicans, vouched for the integrity of the voting process and tabulations. Perdue and Loeffler have not yet publicly acknowledged Biden is president-elect, and they\u2019ve joined Trump in questioning the integrity of the election results in Georgia and in other battleground states Biden won. Loeffler tweeted midday Tuesday: \u201cI will never stop fighting for @realDonaldTrump because he has never stopped fighting for us!\u201d The two senators\u2019 campaign aides did not respond to a fresh inquiry Tuesday asking whether they acknowledge the reality of Biden\u2019s election. ADVERTISEMENT Biden mocked Perdue and Loeffler for publicly backing a failed lawsuit by Texas essentially asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the election results in Georgia and other battlegrounds. The nation\u2019s highest court rejected the request unanimously. \u201cThey fully embraced nullifying nearly 5 million Georgia votes,\u201d said Biden, the first Democratic presidential nominee to win the state since 1992. \u201cMaybe your senators were just confused. Maybe they think they represent Texas. Well, if you want to do the bidding of Texas, you should be running in Texas.\u201d Biden edged Trump in Georgia by about 12,000 votes out of the 5 million cast, a turnout increase of about 850,000 over 2016. There\u2019s an expectation of some dropoff for the second round, though political observers expect a record runoff turnout. The first day of early voting Monday offered mixed results. According to the secretary of state\u2019s office, 23% more people cast in-person ballots on Monday than on the opening early voting day in October. But according to an analysis by Ryan Anderson, a nonpartisan data analyst in Atlanta, the number of returned absentee ballots so far is about 37% lower than during the general election. Despite their reticence to accept Biden\u2019s victory, Republicans have tacitly acknowledged Biden\u2019s win in the way they talk about the importance of the runoffs. Perdue, Loeffler and their allies have issued dire warnings that a Democratic Senate would ensure a leftward lurch in the federal government. Democrats would need to win both Georgia seats to force a 50-50 Senate, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tiebreaking vote. Republicans need one of the two Georgia seats for McConnell to remain majority leader and set the Senate agenda. McConnell has repeatedly described himself as the barrier for Democrats\u2019 policy ideas on health care, overhauling the nation\u2019s energy grid and reducing the carbon pollution that causes climate change, among other matters. Democrats in Georgia have not been as eager as their Republican rivals to embrace the nationalization of the runoffs, partly because Democratic victories in the longtime GOP stronghold still involve a patchwork coalition that ranges from progressives and liberals in the metro areas to moderate suburbanites and small-town residents who dislike Trump but may be more reticent about Democrats controlling Capitol Hill and the White House. Speaking before Biden, Ossoff took on the matter most directly. \u201cIf Mitch McConnell controls the Senate, they\u2019re going to try to do to Joe and Kamala just like they tried to do President Obama,\u201d he said, alluding to McConnell\u2019s years of blocking legislation and Obama\u2019s court appointments. \u201cThey will block the COVID relief that we need. They will block the $15 minimum wage. They will block the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act that we need. They will block affordable health care. We can\u2019t let that happen, Georgia.\u201d Warnock declared the outcome a \u201ca matter of life and death\u201d because of COVID-19 relief and health care legislation, though he didn\u2019t explicitly mention McConnell or Senate control. Biden also used the trip to catch up with key supporters who helped him win Georgia. He praised voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams, Democrats\u2019 2018 candidate for governor, for her years of organizing work that registered hundreds of thousands of new voters. He also singled out Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who gave Biden one of his earliest high-profile endorsements in 2019. After he spoke, Biden huddled with Bottoms, who has been mentioned for various Cabinet posts, before departing. ___ Associated Press writer Kate Brumback in Atlanta contributed to this report.",
        "summarized_context": "President-elect Joe Biden traveled to Georgia to campaign for Democratic Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in the upcoming runoff races. Biden thanked Georgia voters for their support in the presidential election and praised them for standing up against attempts to invalidate their votes. He criticized Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler for supporting the Texas lawsuit seeking to overturn election results. Ossoff and Warnock expressed confidence in their campaigns and promised to pass new voting rights and civil rights acts if elected. The outcome of the runoffs will determine which party controls the Senate."

The truth is he doesn\u2019t care about anyone else but himself.\u201d\nTroye is not the first aide to leave the White House and speak out, but as one of the closest aides to the vice president during the pandemic response her comments are a stinging rebuke of the president, who is in a tough re-election battle and polls show Americans a majority of Americans are dissatisfied with his response.\nMiles Taylor, who served as the chief of staff of Trump's Department of Homeland Security, has also left and criticized the administration. He said he is voting for Biden. Others include former national security advisor John Bolton, who wrote a scathing book about his time in the White House.\nTroye said that during her time there, the president showed indifference.\n\u201dWhen we were in a task force meeting, the president said, \u2018maybe this COVID thing is a good thing, I don't like shaking hands with people, I don't have to shake hands with these disgusting people\u2019,\u201d she said in the ad.\n\u201cThose disgusting people are the same people that he claims to care about. These are the people still going to his rallies today, who have complete faith in who he is.\u201d\nTroye, who is a Republican, said that meeting \u201cdefined who he was\u201d and she had to leave the White House and decided that she would vote for Biden. The ad comes as the White House is defending the president against a new book and recorded audio by veteran journalist Bob Woodward in which Trump said he downplayed the seriousness of COVID-19 in the beginning.\nPence dismissed Troye\u2019s claims on Thursday.\n\u201cWell, I haven't read her comments in any detail but it reads to me like one more disgruntled employee who's left the White House and has decided to play politics during an election year,\u201d Pence said.\n\u201cI think my staff has indicated that she made no comments like that when she was serving on our team here at the White House Coronavirus Taskforce and I couldn't be more proud of the work we've done all along the way and the leadership President Trump has provided.\u201d\nTrump also characterized Troye as a disgruntled employee.\n\u201dI have no idea who she is, she doesn\u2019t know me. It\u2019s just another person who leaves. We have a letter from her that was the most beautiful going away letter,\u201d he said. \u201cThey let her go, with cause, but they let her go.\u201d\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany later tweeted a picture of what she said was Troye's letter.\n\u201dInteresting departure letter from a disgruntled former detailee who typically sat in the overflow room of task force,\u201d she tweeted. \u201dLESS THAN 2 months ago: 'I have witnessed first hand how dedicated and committed all of you have been to doing the right thing.'\u201d\nAccording to the letter shared by McEnany, Troye said that it was an \u201dabsolute honor working closely with all of you and your staffs, as part of the brain trust that has valiantly\u201d faced this pandemic challenge.\n\u201dI will always be rooting for you knowing that you will continue to fight the good fight,\u201d the letter said. \u201dKnow that your unwavering commitment in the midst of the hardest times is an inspiration to me and Americans across the nation. We are grateful for everything you are doing to keep us all safe.\u201d\nTroye made no mention of the president in the letter and only said that it has been \u201dthe experience of a lifetime\u201d supporting Pence and her team on the coronavirus effort.",

            "Washington (CNN) FBI Director Christopher Wray said Thursday that Russia has been \u201dvery active\u201d in its efforts to influence US elections, with the primary goal being to \u201ddenigrate\u201d Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden .\nTestifying before the House Homeland Security Committee, Wray told lawmakers that Russia is primarily interfering through \u201dmalign foreign influence in an effort to hurt Biden's campaign\u201d -- echoing the intelligence community's public assessment on Moscow's meddling efforts issued last month.\nWray's comments come as President Donald Trump and several other top administration officials have recently attempted to play up the theory that China is meddling to get Biden elected, while downplaying well-founded reports that Russia is trying to help Trump win again , like it did in 2016.\nForeign election interference efforts differ from what was observed in 2016, when there was also an effort to target election infrastructure, Wray said. \u201dWe have not seen that second part yet this year or this cycle, but we certainly have seen very active, very active efforts by the Russians to influence our election in 2020,\u201d he added.\nAccording to Wray, Russia is using social media, proxies, state media and online journals to sow \u201ddivisiveness and discord\u201d and \u201dprimarily to denigrate Vice President Biden and what the Russians see as kind of an anti-Russian establishment.\u201d\nIntelligence officials have said they have uncovered evidence that Russia is currently interfering in the election to hurt Biden's campaign. Separately, some evidence has already emerged about Moscow's efforts, including Facebook's announcement earlier this month that a troll group that was part of Russia's attempt to interfere in the 2016 election is trying to target Americans again.\nBut while the intelligence community has assessed that China and Iran prefer Trump to lose in November, officials have offered no indication, to date, that either country is acting on that preference in the same way as Russia, according to public statements issued by the intelligence community and sources familiar with the underlying evidence.\n\u201dWe assess that China prefers that President Trump -- whom Beijing sees as unpredictable -- does not win reelection. China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China's interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China,\u201d the top US intelligence official on election security, Bill Evanina, said in an unprecedented public statement issued last month.\nEvanina went on to say, \u201dChina will continue to weigh the risks and benefits of aggressive action,\u201d but to date has primarily engaged in overt efforts like ramping up public criticism of the current administration over non-election-related issues, including its coronavirus response and move to close Beijing's consulate in Houston.\nRussia, on the other hand, is using a range of measures primarily to denigrate Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia establishment, Evanina wrote in the same statement.\n\u201dThis is consistent with Moscow's public criticism of him when he was Vice President for his role in the Obama Administration's policies on Ukraine and its support for the anti-Putin opposition inside Russia,\u201d Evanina said. \u201dSome Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump's candidacy on social media and Russian television.\u201d\nBut in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer earlier this month, Attorney General William Barr went out of his way to dilute the intelligence community's assessment that Russia is again actively interfering in a US election.\n\u201dI accept that there is some preliminary activity that suggests that they might try again,\u201d Barr said of Russia. \u201dIt wouldn't surprise me if Russia tries something again of the same general genre before.\u201d\nUS intelligence officials and the Senate Intelligence Committee have made bolder assertions warning of the threat Russia poses this year after it hacked the Democrats in 2016 and ran social media influence operations during the 2016 and 2018 elections.\n\u201dThe threat is ongoing,\u201d Sen. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican who chaired much of the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russian election interference, said in a statement last month after the panel released the findings of its bipartisan probe. \u201dMy hope is that this report and the Committee's work will provide the American people with more insight into the threats facing our nation and the steps necessary to stop them.\u201d\nWray: Antifa is 'an ideology'\nWray also testified that the majority of protesters in the streets are peaceful.\n\u201dThere's no question the biggest number is peaceful protesters,\u201d Wray said.\nWray was pressed repeatedly, mainly by Republicans, about the threat from Antifa. He responded that they are not a group or organization but rather a movement or ideology.\n\u201dWe look at Antifa as more of an ideology or a movement than an organization. To be clear, we do have quite a number of properly predicated domestic terrorism investigations into violent anarchist extremists, any number of whom self-identify with the Antifa movement, and that's part of this broader group of domestic violent extremists,\u201d Wray said.\nSome individual are being investigated, as are smaller regional \u201dnodes,\u201d Wray said. Antifa is on the spectrum of anti-government movements on both the left and the right, he added.\nThis story has been updated with Wray's comments on Antifa.",
            "FBI Director Christopher Wray warned that the Russian government is \u201cvery active\u201d in efforts to influence the 2020 presidential election by harming Democratic nominee Joe Biden.\nAppearing before the House Homeland Security Committee on Thursday, less than two months to go until Election Day, Wray stressed that he has not seen election infrastructure targeted by Russian cyberactors like in 2016.\n\u201cI think the intelligence committee\u2019s consensus is Russia continues to try to influence our elections, primarily through what we would call malign foreign influence, as opposed to what we saw in 2016, where there was also an effort to target election infrastructure \u2014 you know, cybertargeting. We have not seen that second part yet this year or this cycle,\u201d Wray said. \u201cBut we certainly have seen very active efforts by the Russians to influence our election in 2020 through what I would call more the malign foreign influence side of things \u2014 social media, use of proxies, state media, online journals, etc. \u2014 in an effort to both sow divisiveness and discord, and I think the intelligence community has assessed this publicly, primarily to denigrate Vice President Biden and what the Russians see as kind of an anti-Russian establishment. That\u2019s essentially what we\u2019re seeing in 2020.\u201d\nBill Evanina, who leads the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, released an intelligence assessment in August warning that Russia is \u201cusing a range of measures to primarily denigrate\u201d Biden, including that \u201cpro-Russia Ukrainian parliamentarian Andriy Derkach is spreading claims about corruption \u2014 including through publicizing leaked phone calls \u2014 to undermine\u201d the Democrat's candidacy. The same statement said that China \u201cprefers\u201d that President Trump not win reelection and is \u201cexpanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020\u201d in order to \u201cpressure political figures it views as opposed to China\u2019s interests.\u201d The counterintelligence official also said that Iran \u201cseeks to undermine\u201d Trump's presidency.\nMicrosoft revealed last week that Russian, Chinese, and Iranian hackers were all targeting people and groups tied to the election. The Treasury Department announced sanctions against Derkach as well as three Russian nationals for supporting the Internet Research Agency, a Russian social media troll farm.\nWray was not directly asked to provide specifics about Chinese or Iranian election influence efforts in 2020, but he did say that the FBI was taking action to secure the vote.\n\u201cAmericans must have confidence in our voting system and our election infrastructure. That\u2019s why the security of our elections is and will continue to be one of our highest priorities,\u201d Wray said. \u201cWe will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections, and we\u2019re working closely with our federal, state, and local partners as well as the private sector to share information, bolster security, and identify and disrupt any threats.\u201d\nWray said that \u201cjust recently, for example, we shared threat indicators with both Facebook and Twitter that allowed them to take down fake accounts created as part of a Russian disinformation campaign before those accounts could develop a broader following.\u201d\nAfter a tip from the FBI, Facebook announced in early September that it had taken down a small network of 13 Russian accounts and two pages tied to Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, and Twitter similarly said that it suspended a small number of accounts \u201cfor platform manipulation that we can reliably attribute to Russian state actors\u201d that were operating a site called PeaceData. Graphika, a New York-based social media analysis firm, revealed that \u201cthe website employed real and apparently unwitting individuals, typically novice freelance writers, to write its articles\u201d and that it published over 500 articles in English and over 200 articles in Arabic in 2020. The group said that \u201cthe network appeared designed to target progressive and left-wing audiences, including in the United States and United Kingdom.\u201d\n\u201cThey were able to shut down Russian influence accounts really right before they could ever build a following. And the faster we can do that and the more agile way we can do that, the better,\u201d Wray said on Thursday. \u201cMisinformation or disinformation or fake information is only effective if it seems credible. And it\u2019s only credible if it\u2019s built up some reservoir of credibility. \u2026 And if we\u2019re able to shut them down and knock them back quickly before they can really build up that credibility, then it\u2019s not going to stop it, but it means it\u2019s much, much less effective. So, we need more of that. We\u2019re having more of that.\u201d\nRobert Mueller\u2019s 2019 special counsel report said that Russians interfered in the 2016 election in a \u201csweeping and systematic fashion\u201d but \u201cdid not establish\u201d criminal collusion between Russians and anyone in Trump's orbit.\n\u201cI think, in many ways, what concerns me the most is the steady drumbeat of misinformation and sort of amplification of smaller cyberintrusions that contribute over time. I worry that they will contribute over time to a lack of confidence of American voters and citizens in the validity of their vote,\u201d Wray testified. \u201cI think that would be a perception, not a reality. I think Americans can and should have confidence in our election system and certainly in our democracy. But I worry that people will take on a feeling of futility because of all of the noise and confusion that\u2019s generated, and that\u2019s a very hard problem to combat.\u201d\n"

Wray also addressed the threat of Antifa, stating that it is an ideology rather than an organization."

            "WASHINGTON \u2013 Former Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan was interviewed for eight hours Friday by a federal prosecutor leading the Justice Department's review of the Russia investigation.\nBrennan, who was CIA director from 2013 to 2017, was interviewed by U.S. Attorney John Durham on issues related to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Nick Shapiro, Brennan's former deputy chief of staff, said in a statement late Friday night. Attorney General William Barr appointed Durham last year to review the origins of the Russia investigation and the FBI's surveillance activities.\nCritics see the review as a politically charged attempt to undermine the results of the Russia probe and to give Trump ammunition ahead of the presidential election. The Russia investigation found that the Trump campaign was an eager beneficiary of Russia's systematic efforts to influence the 2016 election but did not find evidence of a conspiracy with the Kremlin.\nStart the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.\nDurham told Brennan he isn't under a criminal investigation and is, instead, a witness to the events under review, according to Shapiro. Brennan spoke with Durham and his team about the CIA's intelligence activities leading up to the November 2016 presidential election, as well as the intelligence community's findings about Russian threats to U.S. elections.\n'Grave counterintelligence threat': Republican-led panel rebukes Paul Manafort\nAccording to the intelligence community's assessment, published in January 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an aggressive campaign to influence U.S. elections and help elect Trump.\n\u201dBrennan provided details on the efforts made by the Intelligence Community to understand and disrupt the actions taken by Russia to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,\u201d Shapiro said in the statement.\nBrennan's interview came just days after Durham charged a former FBI lawyer of falsifying an email used to support the FBI's surveillance of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page. The case against Kevin Clinesmith, who pleaded guilty Wednesday, is the first brought by the Justice Department as a result of Durham's politically fraught inquiry.\nCongressional Republicans have cast the development as proof that top FBI and Justice Department leaders in the Obama administration conspired to undermine Trump. Barr has said that former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, are not under a criminal investigation, seeming to contradict Trump's claims that his predecessor had committed crimes.\n'I am concerned': Attorney General Barr says he will review government 'spying' on Trump campaign\nBarr has been highly critical of the Russia investigation and the work of former special counsel Robert Mueller, who took over the probe.\n\u00a9 Bob Child, AP John Durham is looking into the origins of the FBI's investigation into Russian election interference.\nBarr told the House Judiciary Committee last month that he will not wait until after the election to release Durham's findings. He also told Fox News recently that there would be \u201dsignificant developments\u201d before November.\nBrennan, according to Shapiro, asked Durham why the Justice Department is scrutinizing the CIA's activities, noting that the agency's findings \u201dhave been validated\u201d by the Mueller probe, as well a separate investigation into Russia's actions by the GOP-led Senate Intelligence Committee.\nBrennan also told Durham that Trump and Barr have politicized Durham's work, tarnishing \u201dthe independence & integrity of the Justice Department.\u201d\n\u201dIt is Brennan's fervent hope that the results of the Durham review will be apolitical and not influenced by personal or partisan agendas,\u201d Shapiro said.\nA Justice Department spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday.\nContributing: Kevin Johnson\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Ex-CIA chief John Brennan interviewed for 8 hours as part of Durham's review of Russia probe\nVideo: Mueller prosecutor calls Senate Intel\u2019s report on Russian interference \u2018a remarkable document\u2019 (MSNBC)",
            "U.S. Attorney John Durham interviewed former CIA Director John Brennan for eight hours on Friday as he wraps up his inquiry into the Russia investigation, according to a statement on behalf of the Obama administration intelligence chief.\nGetting ahead of whatever report the federal prosecutor is expected to release, which President Trump and his allies believe will be a damning assessment of the actions taken by top intelligence and national security officials taken against Trump's campaign and administration, Brennan also declared he confronted Durham about the politicization of his efforts.\nA statement from Nick Shapiro, Brennan's former deputy chief of staff and senior adviser, also claimed the former CIA director was told he is not under criminal investigation.\nThey met at CIA headquarters and discussed \u201dissues related to Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,\u201d Shapiro said, adding that Durham informed Brennan that \u201che is not a subject or a target of a criminal investigation, and that he is only a witness to events that are under review.\u201d\nThe statement, which was first obtained by Politico, said, \u201cBrennan welcomed the opportunity to answer Mr. Durham\u2019s questions related to a wide range of intelligence-related activities undertaken by CIA before the 2016 presidential election as well as the Intelligence Community Assessment published in early January 2017.\u201d\nShapiro said, \u201cBrennan provided details on the efforts made by the Intelligence Community to understand and disrupt the actions taken by Russian to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Brennan expressed appreciation for the professional manner in which Mr. Durham and his team conducted the interview.\u201d\nDurham was assigned to review the origins of the Russia investigation last year by Attorney General William Barr. It was upgraded to a criminal investigation in the fall. As anticipation builds for what the prosecutors may find and reveal, especially so close to the 2020 election, Democrats and some national security veterans have raised concerns about Trump and Barr attempting to set up an \u201dOctober Surprise.\u201d\nApparently clear of legal jeopardy, Brennan took aim at the premise of the inquiry.\nThe fierce Trump critic \u201cquestioned why the analytic tradecraft and the findings of the ICA are being scrutinized by the Department of Justice, especially since they have been validated by the Mueller Report as the bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Review,\u201d the statement from Shapiro said.\nDurham is looking into whether Brennan took politicized actions to pressure the rest of the intelligence community to match his conclusions about Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s motivations. Barr confirmed Durham is scrutinizing the assessment.\n\u201cThere was definitely Russian, uh, interference,\u201d Barr said in June. \u201cI think Durham is looking at the intelligence community\u2019s ICA \u2014 the report that they did in December [2016]. And he\u2019s sort of examining all the information that was ... the basis for their conclusions. So to that extent, I still have an open mind, depending on what he finds.\u201d\nThe 2017 assessment concluded with \u201dhigh confidence\u201d that Putin \u201cordered an influence campaign in 2016\u201d and Russia worked to \u201cundermine public faith\u201d in U.S. democracy, \u201ddenigrate\u201d former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, \u201dharm her electability and potential presidency,\u201d and \u201cdeveloped a clear preference\u201d for Trump. The National Security Agency diverged on one aspect, expressing only \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d that Putin actively tried to help Trump win.\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee released a report in April defending the intelligence community assessment, saying that Senate investigators found no evidence of political pressure to reach a specific conclusion and determining that the assessments by the CIA, FBI, and NSA present \u201da coherent and well-constructed intelligence basis.\u201d\nThose findings clash with a 2018 report from the House Intelligence Committee, led at the time by Rep. Devin Nunes, a California Republican. That assessment, which was not bipartisan, concluded that \u201cthe majority of the Intelligence Community Assessment judgments on Russia's election activities employed proper analytic tradecraft\u201d but found the \u201djudgments on Putin's strategic intentions did not.\u201d\nThe statement from Shapiro on Friday claimed Brennan told Durham the \u201crepeated efforts\u201d of Trump and Barr \u201dto politicize Mr. Durham\u2019s work have been appalling and have tarnished the independence and integrity\u201d of the Justice Department.\n\u201cIt is Brennan\u2019s fervent hope that the results of the Durham review will be apolitical and not influenced by personal or partisan agendas,\u201d the statement concluded.\nDurham collected his first guilty plea on Wednesday from former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith, who admitted to a false statements charge for altering a CIA email in 2017 that helped justify the continued Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act surveillance of onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page by claiming he was \u201dnot a source\u201d for the agency.\nDurham is looking into how British ex-spy Christopher Steele's discredited dossier was used in the 2017 assessment, why former FBI Director James Comey and his deputy, Andrew McCabe, insisted on it being part of the assessment, how allegations from the dossier ended up in an appendix of the assessment, and whether Brennan made misleading assertions about the research\u2019s use. The top federal prosecutor in Connecticut is also reportedly reviewing Brennan\u2019s handling of a secret source said to be close to the Kremlin and working to find out what role that person's information played in the assessment.\nBrennan has sought to pin questions about the discredited dossier on the FBI, which was used to obtain a FISA to wiretap Page. The CIA director recently found out he had been blocked from accessing his classified notes and records while working on his forthcoming memoir."

            "\u00a9 Drew Angerer/Getty Images, FILE Attorney General William Barr listens during an event to highlight the Department of Justice grants to combat human trafficking, in the Indian Treaty Room of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Aug. 4, 2020, in Washington, D.C.\nFormer FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith is expected to plead guilty Friday after admitting that he doctored a document used in the application process authorizing surveillance against for a former Trump campaign aide -- part of the first criminal case brought by U.S. Attorney John Durham in his investigation examining the origins of the Russia probe.\nDepartment of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz had previously outlined Clinesmith's conduct in his report released last year examining the Russia investigation, and referred Clinesmith to the DOJ for prosecution after finding he had altered an email from the CIA that was used by the government in the final FISA renewal application authorizing surveillance of former Trump aide Carter Page.\nAccording to a criminal information filing made public Friday, Clinesmith pleaded to one felony charge for making false statements.\n\u201dHe will be pleading guilty,\u201d Clinesmith's attorney Justin Shur told ABC News in a statement Friday. \u201dKevin deeply regrets having altered the email. It was never his intent to mislead the court or his colleagues as he believed the information he relayed was accurate. But Kevin understands what he did was wrong and accepts responsibility.\u201d\nThe news of Clinesmith's plea was first reported by the New York Times.\nThe first FISA application targeting Page was first approved in October of 2016 and signed by then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates. The first renewal came in January of 2017 under Yates\u2019 signature, the second came in April of 2017 signed by Acting Attorney General Dan Boente and third and final renewal application was filed under the signature of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in June of 2017.\nClinesmith\u2019s alteration only impacted that final renewal application in June of 2017 and was not relevant to the earlier FISA warrants. Horowitz's report last December outlined numerous errors and omissions by the FBI agents who handled the applications for Page, and the DOJ subsequently declared the final two applications were, including the one implicating Clinesmith, while declining to take a position on the first two applications.\nThe criminal information filing does not include any allegation that Clinesmith's decision to alter the document was related to any bias against President Trump specifically or part of a broader effort to undermine his presidency.\nAttorney General Barr last night appeared to preview Clinesmith's plea in an appearance on Fox News host Sean Hannity's show Thursday evening, which he described as \u201dnot an earth-shattering development\u201d for Durham's investigation but \u201dan indication that things are moving along at the proper pace as dictated by the facts in the investigation.\u201d\nBarr's announcement came just hours after President Trump signaled he's impatient about the lack of action taken by the Justice Department against his political opponents.\n\u201dWe're not going to do anything inappropriate before the election but we're not being dictated to by this schedule -- what's dictating the timing of this are developments in the case,\u201d Barr said. \u201dAnd there will be developments tomorrow -- there will be a development in the case. You know, it's not an earth-shattering development but it is an indication that things are moving along at the proper pace as dictated by the facts in the investigation.\u201d\nIt's unclear, however, whether Clinesmith's plea will satisfy Trump or those on the right who have demanded charges against more senior officials involved in launching the Russia investigation.\nTrump in an interview with Fox Business Network host Maria Bartiromo Thursday said Barr's reputation as attorney general would hinge on the results of Durham's investigation.\n\u201cI hope he\u2019s doing a great job, and I hope they\u2019re not going to be politically correct,\u201d Trump said. \u201dBill Barr can go down as the greatest attorney general in the history of our country, or he can go down as an average guy. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\nResponding directly to Trump's comments in his interview with Hannity, Barr said, \u201dif I was worried about being politically correct, I would not have joined this administration.\u201d\n\u00a9 Drew Angerer/Getty Images, FILE Attorney General William Barr listens during an event to highlight the Department of Justice grants to combat human trafficking, in the Indian Treaty Room of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Aug. 4, 2020, in Washington, D.C.\nDurham's last public statement during his investigation was in December of last year, when he and Barr following the release of Horowitz's report into the origins of the Russia investigation said they disagreed with Horowitz's assessment that the investigation was launched with proper cause.\nBarr's recent comments on how he plans to handle Durham's findings have caused increasing alarm among Democrats, who have argued he will seek to use the investigation to benefit Trump politically in the months and weeks leading up to the November 3 election.\nWhile Barr has repeatedly insisted he will take no action based on political considerations, he has at the same time set down Election Day more recently as a benchmark for when he hopes to reveal some of what Durham has uncovered.\n\u201dWe're all aware of the calendar and, you know we're not going to do anything for the purposes of affecting an election,\u201d Barr said in an interview with conservative commentator Buck Sexton Wednesday. \u201dBut, you know, we are trying to get some, some things accomplished before the election.\u201d\nBarr has also suggested Durham's investigation has faced delays in part because the COVID-19 crisis has made it difficult to impanel grand juries which would issue subpoenas for witnesses or indictments.\nPreviously, Barr has taken umbrage when President Trump openly weighed into criminal matters before his department.\nBarr's Thursday tease of the latest Durham development is reminiscent of Barr's intervention in the sentencing process for Trump's longtime ally Roger Stone back in February, just hours after Trump tweeted, \u201dCannot allow this miscarriage of justice!\u201d\nIn an interview with ABC News, Barr denied his actions were in any way connected with Trump's comments and added that Trump's tweets \u201dmake it impossible for me to do my job.\u201d\n\u201dI cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me,\u201d Barr said.\nIn addition to his comments about Barr Thursday, Trump also distanced himself from his FBI Director Christopher Wray, who he said has not recently been cooperative enough with Republican lawmakers demanding more documents related to the Russia investigation's origins.\n\u201dChristopher Wray was put there. We have an election coming up,\u201d Trump said. \u201dI wish he was more forthcoming, he certainly hasn't been. There are documents that they want to get, and we have said we want to get. We're going to find out if he's going to give those documents. But certainly he's been very, very protective.\u201d\nTrump added Wray was put in his job \u201dby a certain person,\u201d but Trump himself nominated Wray for the position after his firing of former FBI Director James Comey, saying in a statement at the time that Wray \u201dis an impeccably qualified individual, and I know that he will again serve his country as a fierce guardian of the law and model of integrity.\u201d",
            "A former lawyer with the FBI plans to plead guilty Friday to falsifying a key document related to surveillance against a onetime Trump campaign associate as part of a deal with U.S. Attorney John Durham.\nKevin Clinesmith, who worked on both the Hillary Clinton emails investigation and the Trump-Russia inquiry, will admit that he falsified a document during the bureau\u2019s targeting of Carter Page, according to multiple reports. Clinesmith, 38, claimed in early 2017 that Page was \u201dnot a source\u201d for the CIA when the CIA had actually told the bureau on multiple occasions that Page was an operational contact for them \u2014 a falsehood used to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act renewal against Page. Durham submitted a five-page filing to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Friday, noting Clinesmith was being charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(3) for \u201cFalse Statements.\u201d\nAttorney General William Barr had hinted at a \u201cdevelopment\u201d in Durham\u2019s investigation during a Fox News interview on Thursday night.\nClinesmith\u2019s responsibilities during the Trump-Russia investigation included communicating with \u201canother specific United States government agency,\u201d which is believed to be the CIA, as well as providing support to the FBI special agents working with the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division to pursue FISA warrants and renewals against Page.\nDurham noted on Friday that the first three FISAs didn\u2019t include Page\u2019s relationship with the CIA and wrote that Page went public to claim that he had helped the CIA in the past prior to the FBI's submission of fourth FISA.\nIn June 2017, Clinesmith was tasked by a special agent for the bureau with determining whether Page had ever been a \u201csource\u201d for the CIA. A liaison at the CIA reminded Clinesmith that the agency had already told the FBI in August 2016 that Page had been an \u201doperational contact\u201d for the agency for years and that Page had provided the CIA with information, but Clinesmith falsely relayed to the FBI agent that the CIA had explicitly told him Page was \u201cnever a source,\u201d according to a DOJ inspector general report released in December. Clinesmith then altered an email from the CIA to claim that Page was \u201cnot a source.\u201d The FBI agent relied upon that fraudulent information when signing the final Page FISA, and the FISA court was never told about Page's potentially exculpatory work for the U.S. government.\n\u201cOn or about June 19, 2017, within the District of Columbia, the defendant, Kevin Clinesmith, did willfully and knowingly make and use a false wiring and document, knowing the same to contain a materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statement and entry in a matter before the jurisdiction of the executive branch and judicial branch of the Government of the United States,\u201d Durham said in the federal court filing.\n\u201cKevin deeply regrets having altered the email,\u201d Clinesmith attorney Emily Damrau told the Washington Examiner. \u201cIt was never his intent to mislead the court or his colleagues as he believed the information he relayed was accurate. But Kevin understands what he did was wrong and accepts responsibility.\u201d\nTrump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh responded to the charges against Clinesmith, saying, \u201dIt\u2019s a good step in the right direction that an FBI official and key member of Robert Mueller\u2019s team of angry Democrats is pleading guilty to doctoring evidence to further the illegal spying operation against President Trump.\u201d\nClinesmith, an assistant general counsel in the National Security and Cyber Law Branch of the FBI\u2019s Office of General Counsel from July 12, 2015 through Sept. 21, 2019, is not directly named in Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report, but it is clear he is the \u201dOffice of General Counsel attorney\u201d who had been acting in response to a question by an FBI agent who was part of the team investigating the Trump campaign.\nSSA 2, who swore in an affidavit for all three FISA renewals against Page in 2017, told Horowitz's investigators that on the third renewal, he wanted \u201da definitive answer to whether Page had ever been a source for another U.S. government agency before he signed the final renewal application.\u201d\nWhile in contact with what was reportedly the CIA's liaison, Clinesmith was reminded that in August 2016, predating the first Page warrant application in October 2016, the other agency informed the FBI that Page \u201ddid, in fact, have a prior relationship with that other agency.\u201d\nAn email from the other government agency's liaison was sent to Clinesmith, who then \u201daltered the liaison's email by inserting the words 'not a source' into it, thus making it appear that the liaison had said that Page was 'not a source' for the other agency\u201d and sent it to \u201dSupervisory Special Agent 2,\u201d Horowitz found.\n\u201dRelying upon this altered email, SSA 2 signed the third renewal application that again failed to disclose Page's past relationship with the other agency,\u201d the inspector general wrote.\nIn a section on \u201dsignificant inaccuracies and omissions\u201d in the Page FISA, Horowitz said the FBI left out that Page had been approved as an \u201doperational contact\u201d for the CIA from 2008 to 2013 and that Page \u201dhad provided information to the other agency concerning his prior contacts with certain Russian intelligence officers, one of which overlapped with facts asserted in the FISA application.\u201d Horowitz also found this other agency gave Page a \u201dpositive assessment,\u201d which was not included in the FISA warrant applications.\nClinesmith\u2019s lawyers, according to the New York Times, \u201cargued that their client did not try to hide the CIA email from other law enforcement officials\u201d and \u201chad provided the unchanged CIA email to Crossfire Hurricane agents and the Justice Department lawyer drafting the original wiretap application.\u201d\nJudge Rosemary Collyer, then the presiding judge over the FISA court, ordered an FBI review of every FISA filing that Clinesmith had ever touched following the release of Horowitz\u2019s report. The FISA court criticized the FBI's handling of the Page applications as \u201dantithetical to the heightened duty of candor described above\u201d and demanded corrective action from the bureau.\nThe initial FISA application and three renewals targeting Page required the approval of top members of the FBI, the Justice Department, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, but they were also handled by lower-level officials. The initial warrant application was approved in October 2016, and renewals came at three-month intervals in January, April, and June 2017. Page, who has denied being an agent for Russia, was never charged with a crime as part of Robert Mueller's investigation, which failed to establish any criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.\nClinesmith worked under former FBI General Counsel James Baker and former Deputy General Counsel Trisha Anderson. He was present at the FBI's meeting in Chicago with Trump 2016 campaign adviser George Papadopoulos in February 2017, Papadopoulos told lawmakers. An Australian diplomat's tip about Papadopoulos telling him that he had heard the Russians had damaging information about Clinton is what officials say prompted the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, dubbed \u201dCrossfire Hurricane,\u201d in late July 2016. Barr and Durham have disputed the legitimacy of the investigation\u2019s launch.\nRecently declassified FBI documents show the counterintelligence briefing the bureau gave to Donald Trump and his national security team during the 2016 campaign was used as a pretext to gather investigative evidence on the Trump campaign and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. Former FBI agent Peter Strzok and Clinesmith signed off on the electronic communication detailing the pretextual briefing.\nIn a scathing July 2018 inspector general report on the FBI's Clinton emails investigation, Clinesmith was mentioned \u2014 again, not by name \u2014 numerous times as being one of the FBI officials who conveyed a possible bias against Trump in instant messages, along with Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page, both of whom have left the bureau.\nIn a lengthy instant message exchange between Clinesmith and another FBI employee on Nov. 9, 2016, the day after Trump\u2019s presidential victory, he lamented Trump\u2019s win and worried about the role he played in the investigation into Trump and his campaign. \u201cMy god damned name is all over the legal documents investigating his staff,\u201d Clinesmith said, adding, \u201cSo, who knows if that breaks to him what he is going to do?\u201d\nOther messages showed Clinesmith, listed in Horowitz's report as \u201dFBI Attorney 2,\u201d expressed favor toward Clinton and said \u201cViva le resistance\u201d in the weeks after Trump's win.\nThe July 2018 report shows Clinesmith claimed his messages reflected only his personal views and that his work was unaffected by them; Horowitz ultimately was unable to find that \u201dimproper considerations, including political bias,\u201d influenced any investigative decisions.\nHorowitz\u2019s December report criticized the Justice Department and the FBI for at least 17 \u201csignificant errors and omissions\u201d related to the FISA warrants against Page and for the bureau's reliance on the Democrat-funded discredited dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele. Declassified footnotes from Horowitz\u2019s report indicate the bureau became aware that Steele\u2019s dossier may have been compromised by Russian disinformation.\nThe DOJ watchdog called the FBI\u2019s explanations for these mistakes \u201cunsatisfactory across the board\u201d and testified he wasn\u2019t sure if the errors were \u201cgross incompetence\u201d or \u201cintentional.\u201d\nIn January, the Justice Department determined that the final two of the four Page FISA warrants \u201cwere not valid.\u201d The FBI told the court it was working to \u201d sequester\u201d all the information from the Page wiretaps, and FBI Director Christopher Wray testified to Congress he was working to \u201d claw back\u201d that intelligence. The FBI director also testified that the bureau likely illegally surveilled Page.\n\u201dAfter several years, Kevin Clinesmith is finally being held accountable and pleading guilty to committing a felony for his involvement in the plot to falsely portray me and, by implication, the Trump administration as traitors. The actions by the full band of government officials and Democrat operatives involved in the creation of the false applications for my FISA surveillance warrants were entirely unconscionable,\u201d Page said in a statement shared with the Washington Examiner.\n\u201dClinesmith, his organization, and their associates put my very life at risk, leading to abusive calls and death threats because of my personal opinions and support for President Trump,\u201d Page added. \u201dThere is a long way to go on the road to restoring justice in America, but certainly, a good first step has now been taken.\u201d\n"

The former FBI lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith, will admit he changed an email from the CIA that was used in seeking renewed court permission in 2017 for a secret wiretap on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, the New York Times reported. \u201cKevin deeply regrets having altered the email,\u201d Justin Shur, a lawyer for Clinesmith, told Reuters in an email. \u201cIt was never his intent to mislead the court or his colleagues as he believed the information he relayed was accurate.

Prosecutors were not expected to reveal any evidence that shows a broader conspiracy that would cast doubt on the decision by the Obama Administration to open a Russia investigation, according to the Times. But after Clinesmith\u2019s guilty plea was announced, President Trump suggested further similar cases were in the works. \u201cThat\u2019s just the beginning, I would imagine, because what happened should never happen again,\u201d Trump said on Friday, describing Clinesmith as a \u201ccorrupt FBI attorney\u201d. \u201cThe fact is they spied on my campaign and they got caught.

            "\u00a9 Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images (Photo by Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images)\nA federal appeals court on Tuesday pushed back on former national security adviser Michael Flynn's effort to have his criminal case dismissed immediately and the Justice Department's reasoning that a judge shouldn't consider why prosecutors dropped his almost 3-year-old guilty plea deal this year amid a political firestorm.\nThe case has had countless twists since Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general and top intelligence official, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his talks with the then-Russian ambassador about approaches that would undermine Obama administration policy before Trump took office.\nThe DC Circuit Court of Appeals hearing Tuesday morning was one of the most consequential yet in the years of court hearings for Flynn, and grappled with major questions about the role of courts and the Justice Department in criminal cases.\nTen judges on the appeals court reheard the arguments, after wiping out a previous Circuit Court ruling that ordered a quick dismissal earlier this summer, wresting oversight of the case from the trial judge.\nThe judges questioned lawyers for Flynn, the Justice Department and for his trial Judge Emmet Sullivan for almost four hours Tuesday, with several judges directing harsh questions primarily to Flynn's lawyer and then the Justice Department's acting solicitor general, both of whom want the case dismissed.\nA judge's role in reviewing case dismissals was \u201dcreated by the Supreme Court to examine cases of favoritism to politically powerful defendants, and that seems to be part of the wheelhouse of what is going on here,\u201d Judge Thomas Griffith, a Republican-appointed jurist who is retiring from the bench Sept. 1, said during the hearing.\nThe judges on Tuesday pressed for explanations on why an appeal in Flynn's case is worthy at this stage -- before Sullivan reviews the Justice Department's motion to dismiss -- and about the authority of Sullivan to second-guess the Justice Department. The judges also closely read the legal steps taken in Flynn's case, raising the possibility that the appeal came out of order.\nMany wove in questions about the divisive politics around Flynn, and how Flynn prompted the appeal before Sullivan had even ruled on dismissal request.\nJudge Robert Wilkins, who previously voted against Flynn and for judicial control during his first appeal round, used a hypothetical of the attorney general being caught on video tape accepting a bribe to let a defendant walk free. In that example, the courts shouldn't have the ability to check a motion to dismiss, the Justice Department lawyer responded.\n\u201dWhat self-respecting Article III district judge would simply jump at an order [to dismiss the case] without doing what he could do to understand both sides?\u201d Judge Nina Pillard, also questioning Flynn and the DOJ's arguments, said.\n\u201dIt's just really striking and remarkable. What is the government worried about?\u201d Pillard asked later, about the Justice Department's opposition to the trial judge's ability to hold a hearing.\nAnother judge, Karen Henderson, who previously sided with Flynn, used her time at the hearing to pose what she called a rhetorical question, a quote from Henry David Thoreau that laid plain her views on the case.\n\u201dAre you familiar\u201d with the quote, she asked Flynn's defense attorney Sidney Powell, \u201d'Some circumstantial evidence is so strong as when you find a fish in the milk. Do you think that applies in this case?'\u201d\nFlynn's attorney answered yes.\nJustice Department said it may have additional info about decision to drop criminal case\nIn one of the more surprising exchanges during the almost four-hour hearing, the Justice Department's attorney told the court that Attorney General William Barr may have additional information that he hasn't shared in court that contributed to the decision to drop Flynn's criminal case.\n\u201dI just wanted to make clear that it may be possible that the Attorney General had before him information that he was not able to share with the court,\u201d acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall said during the arguments. \u201dAnd so what we put in front of the court were the reasons that we could, but it may not be the whole picture available to the executive branch.\u201d\nThe assertion adds another layer of intrigue to a case that has allowed conservatives and especially President Donald Trump to sow doubt about the actions of investigators as they pursued Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nWall raised the possibility of additional information when pressed on the judicial branch's ability to question Justice Department reasoning in its prosecutorial decisions. The Justice Department has argued the judiciary shouldn't be able to second-guess the executive branch's choices to bring or drop criminal cases.\nBut it was the same type of vague flagging of unknown details about the Russia investigation that Barr has done in media interviews where he condemns the FBI's or the special counsel's office's approach to Flynn. Barr has launched reviews of both the Flynn case and intelligence used in the early Russia investigation, and has come under fire for his reversal on prosecuting Flynn, who pleaded guilty, and for fueling speculation of so-called \u201dDeep State\u201d misconduct as Trump runs for reelection.\nSeparation of powers fight\nThe case is ultimately a separation of powers fight between a judge's authority and the Justice Department's decision to drop a prosecution, set against the political divide over the Russia investigation, which President Donald Trump, Barr and Flynn's lawyers have fueled this year by questioning how the FBI conducted the probe.\nBefore Flynn prompted appeals, Sullivan had questioned the Justice Department's about-face in the case by asking a former federal judge to argue against the dismissal. Sullivan also had planned to hold a hearing before deciding what to do, which he suspended as the appeals courts considered the standoff. Sullivan appeared to be weighing whether he could sentence Flynn without prosecutors' support and whether Flynn could be held in contempt for potentially perjuring himself by swearing separately under oath that he was both guilty and innocent.\nFlynn was set to serve a likely zero to six months in prison for lying.\nTuesday's hearing made clear that if Sullivan were to refuse to dismiss Flynn's case and move toward sentencing, the case would end up back before the appeals court. Sullivan's attorney Beth Wilkinson told the court that when they rule, the judge is likely to follow their order. He also may not ask invasive questions of the Justice Department's process, if he wins and has the opportunity to hold a hearing.\nSome of the judges pressed her on whether Sullivan would be able to refuse to dismiss the case -- exposing how unusual the legal issues have become with Flynn.\nHe called Sullivan's moves to check the Justice Department errors in court, and the Trump Justice Department argued that it alone can decide when a defendant is prosecuted.\nSullivan \u201dfails to justify the district court's unprecedented intrusions on individual liberty and the Executive's charging authority,\u201d DC Appeals Court Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, wrote in the circuit's prior 2-1 opinion in the case.\nA ruling in favor of Flynn could lead to his case's dismissal and strip Sullivan of the power to question the Justice Department's prosecution decision, while a ruling in favor of the judge could keep Flynn's criminal case alive in court --potentially for several more weeks or even into 2021. No ruling is expected Tuesday.\nThough full court hearings are extremely rare at the DC Circuit, this is the second time the court has reheard a case related to the Mueller investigation -- the first being the House subpoena of former White House counsel Don McGahn, which the court decided last week by affirming Congress' right to sue and sending proceedings back to the trial-level judge.\nDC Circuit Judge Greg Katsas -- a Trump appointee who worked in the White House counsel's office while Flynn was national security adviser -- has apparently recused himself from the arguments and will not hear the case on Tuesday. That leaves the makeup of seven Democratic appointees and three Republican appointees on the court as a potential uphill climb for Flynn.\nThe Flynn case has prompted criticism from Republicans on the worthiness of the Russia investigation, from Democrats and former prosecutors on Barr's decision to drop Flynn's charge and from Flynn supporters on the approach taken by Sullivan.\nIn recent weeks, Barr has relied on one of his US attorneys to send FBI documents from the early Russia investigation to the Flynn legal team, which they then make public in court filings.",
            "In their latest bid to end a protracted legal fight immediately, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn\u2019s lawyer and the Justice Department argued on Tuesday that the presiding judge in the former Trump national security adviser's case had the appearance of bias.\nSidney Powell, the former federal prosecutor who took over Flynn\u2019s legal defense last year, and acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall, representing the Justice Department in court following its move to toss the false statements charge against Flynn, clashed with Judge Emmet Sullivan\u2019s attorney, Beth Wilkinson, during a four-hour hearing before 10 skeptical judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\nPowell and Wall argued that Sullivan appeared biased against Flynn, including through his appointment of retired New York Judge John Gleeson as amicus, his resistance to drop the case, and his alleged violation of separation of powers, and said the en banc appeals court should agree with the three-judge appeals panel ruling from June that ordered the Bill Clinton appointee to drop the case. Sullivan, who had asked for a rehearing from the entire appeals court, and Wilkinson said Tuesday that Sullivan should be allowed to hold a hearing on the DOJ's motion to dismiss, saying fears about intrusive questions were speculative.\nThe lengthy questioning from many of the judges indicated they might disagree with the 2-1 June decision from their colleagues, which has been vacated, and would allow Sullivan to hold a dismissal hearing. If the appeals court doesn\u2019t force Sullivan to drop the case, the politically charged legal fight threatens to extend up to and past the Nov. 3 election.\nJudge Thomas Griffith, a George W. Bush appointee, suggested Tuesday that the Flynn case might be \u201cin the wheelhouse\u201d of \u201cfavoritism for a politically powerful defendant\u201d and that \u201cone of the purposes\u201d of Sullivan holding a hearing might be to ask about that. He said the judge\u2019s role is not just \u201cministerial\u201d and that a judge is \u201cnot simply a rubber stamp.\u201d\nPowell argued that Sullivan has \u201cdiscarded any semblance of the unbiased, impartial adjudicator\u201d and has \u201cso invested himself in his own prosecution of General Flynn\u201d that he should be \u201cdisqualified\u201d for the \u201cnow glaring appearance of bias.\u201d She said the appeals court should \u201cvacate the unconstitutional appointment\u201d of Gleeson for the \u201cintrusion into the sole Article II functions of the executive branch\u201d and should \u201ccompel the district court to grant the dismissal.\u201d\n\u201cGen. Flynn is a defendant without a prosecutor, in litigation now without any controversy between the actual parties to the case,\u201d Powell argued, lamenting that Sullivan had appointed an amicus \u201cto usurp the role of prosecutor,\u201d \u201craised the sword of perjury and contempt charges over Flynn\u2019s head,\u201d and \u201cimpermissibly sallied forth to right the wrongs he perceived.\u201d\nWall said the Justice Department now \u201dreluctantly\u201d believes that Sullivan might need to be removed because of \u201ca level of investment in the proceedings that is problematic\u201d and because the judge seems to have \u201cprejudged\u201d some of the questions in the case. Wall said there is \u201ca question about the appearance of impartiality\u201d from Sullivan, though he stressed that \u201cwe\u2019re not saying that there is an actual partiality problem, but we do think there is an appearance problem.\u201d\n\u201dWhen the executive branch no longer wishes to prosecute, and the defendant agrees, the criminal case should be at an end,\u201d Wall said, adding that Sullivan \u201cplans to conduct an intrusive inquiry into the executive\u2019s dismissal decision\u201d which will result in \u201charms\u201d that Sullivan has ignored.\n\u201cIn the end, the criminal charge against petitioner must be dismissed,\u201d Wall argued. \u201cThe only question is how much further the harmful and unnecessary process will be allowed to play out. The answer in our constitutional scheme should be: no further.\u201d\nFlynn, a target of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to FBI investigators about his December 2016 conversations with a Russian envoy, but after changing legal teams, Flynn claimed he was innocent and had been set up by the FBI. After Attorney General William Barr appointed U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Jensen to review the Flynn case, who unearthed a host of new documents deemed exculpatory by Flynn\u2019s lawyers, the Justice Department moved to drop the case.\n\u201cThe extraordinary remedy of mandamus is unwarranted when the district judge has yet to decide a pending motion. By appointing an amicus, scheduling a hearing, and receiving briefing from the parties, the district court is doing what district courts do \u2014 preparing to rule on a motion,\u201d Wilkinson argued.\n\u201cThe judge has not asked any questions of the government or anyone else,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cNo fact-finding has been requested, and briefing by the parties as not finished. Once that process is complete and the judge studies the papers, there may be little left to discuss at the hearing. The parties\u2019 speculation and fears about what the district court might do are not a proper basis for mandamus.\u201d\nThe Justice Department told the district court in May \u201cthat continued prosecution of this case would not serve the interests of justice\u201d as it sought to drop the false statements charges against Flynn after new records were made public.\nRecently declassified FBI documents show that the counterintelligence briefing FBI agent Joseph Pientka gave to Trump during the 2016 campaign was used as a pretext to gather investigative evidence on the Trump campaign and Flynn. Pientka and now-fired FBI special agent Peter Strzok interviewed Flynn at FBI Director James Comey\u2019s behest in January 2017.\nDocuments declassified earlier this year indicate that Strzok abruptly stopped the FBI from closing its investigation into Flynn in early January 2017 at the insistence of the FBI\u2019s \u201cseventh floor\u201d after the bureau had uncovered \u201cno derogatory information\u201d on Flynn.\nNotes from Bill Priestap, the FBI's former head of counterintelligence, show him asking, \u201cWhat is our goal? Truth/Admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?\u201d"

        "context": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. appeals court judges on Tuesday signaled reluctance to compel a federal judge to immediately drop the criminal case against President Donald Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn as the Justice Department has demanded despite Flynn twice pleading guilty to lying to the FBI. Ten judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard fresh arguments in the politically charged case after a three-judge panel of the same court, in a 2-1 ruling on June 24, had directed U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan to grant the department\u2019s motion to clear Flynn. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, pleaded guilty two times to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russia\u2019s then-ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, concerning U.S. sanctions imposed on Moscow under President Barack Obama before Trump took office in 2017. Flynn\u2019s lawyer Sidney Powell and Justice Department lawyer Jeff Wall pressed the judges during a hearing lasting about four hours to prevent Sullivan from using his discretion on whether to grant the department\u2019s motion for dismissal. Beth Wilkinson, a lawyer for Sullivan, said it would be premature for the appeals court to end the case now, before the judge has even ruled on the department\u2019s request. \u201cThe government\u2019s entire argument comes down to speculation about what might happen,\u201d Wilkinson said. Several of the judges expressed sympathy for Sullivan\u2019s position. \u201cThe integrity and independence of the courts is also at play here,\u201d Judge Cornelia Pillard told Wall, asking whether any \u201cself-respecting\u201d federal district judge \u201cwould simply jump and enter an order without doing what he can to understand both sides.\u201d \u201cAnd your position,\u201d Pillard told Powell, \u201cis that, \u2018No, he can\u2019t hear both sides on the law and he has to drop the case like a hot potato.\u2019\u201d FILE PHOTO: Former national security adviser Michael Flynn exits a vehicle as he arrives at U.S. District Court in Washington, U.S., December 18, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo Democrats and other critics have accused Attorney General Bill Barr of protecting Trump\u2019s friends and allies in this and other high-profile criminal cases, warping the rule of law. Flynn was charged under former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation that detailed Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy. While awaiting sentencing by Sullivan, Flynn sought to withdraw his plea, switching lawyers to pursue a scorched-earth approach that accused the FBI of setting him up. Trump has said Flynn was treated unfairly in the case. Judge Thomas Griffith suggested that Sullivan can scrutinize whether Flynn had been given favorable treatment because he is a Trump ally. Griffith added that Sullivan \u201cis not simply a rubber stamp\u201d for the Justice Department\u2019s wishes, echoing Sullivan\u2019s view. Wall told the judges that Sullivan lacks the constitutional authority to second-guess the dropping of Flynn\u2019s case. Judge David Tatel pressed Wall over that argument, asking, \u201cDon\u2019t courts regularly scrutinize the executive\u2019s stated justifications?\u201d Wall also hinted that the department moved to drop the case because of findings that have not been made public. \u201cIt may be possible the attorney general had before him information that he was not able to share with the court,\u201d Wall said, without offering specifics. Powell accused Sullivan of \u201cusurping\u201d the job of a prosecutor and said the judge \u201cimpermissibly sallied forth to right the wrongs that he perceived.\u201d While the judges seemed inclined to rule against Flynn at this juncture, some expressed sympathy for his argument that Sullivan ultimately cannot force the department to prosecute a case it wants to drop.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo The D.C. Circuit\u2019s eventual decision could be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Flynn played a prominent role in Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. But Trump fired him in 2017 after only 24 days as national security adviser when it emerged that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence and the FBI about his Kislyak dealings.",
        "summarized_context": "Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn's lawyer and the Justice Department argued in court on Tuesday that the presiding judge in Flynn's case, Judge Emmet Sullivan, appeared biased. They claimed that Sullivan's appointment of a retired judge as amicus, his resistance to dropping the case, and his alleged violation of separation of powers demonstrated bias. They argued that the appeals court should uphold the previous ruling ordering Sullivan to drop the case. However, the lengthy questioning from the judges indicated that they might allow Sullivan to hold a dismissal hearing. The politically charged legal fight could extend past the November election if Sullivan is not forced to drop the case."

            "\u00a9 Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Rep. Eliot Engel.\nA top House Democrat has subpoenaed four senior aides to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, accusing them of resisting interviews in an investigation of President Donald Trump's firing of State Department Inspector General Steve Linick.\nHouse Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) issued the subpoenas Monday to Brian Bulatao, the undersecretary of State for management and a longtime Pompeo associate, as well as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Mike Miller, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Marik String and senior adviser Toni Porter.\nThe subpoenas are an escalation in the committee's confrontation with the State Department, which has resisted repeated oversight attempts by the committee since Democrats' impeachment investigation last year.\n\u201dThe Administration continues to cover up the real reasons for Mr. Linick\u2019s firing by stonewalling the Committees\u2019 investigation and refusing to engage in good faith,\u201d Engel, House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a joint statement. \u201dThat stonewalling has made today\u2019s subpoenas necessary.\u201d\nBulatao is seen by Democrats as a linchpin in their investigation, an enforcer of sorts for Pompeo who Linick said attempted to bully him into shying away from sensitive investigations about Pompeo's use of taxpayer resources and stewardship of an arms sale to Saudi Arabia. The other aides, Democrats say, were aware of the circumstances of Linick's departure or of the two investigations that he said raised questions about Pompeo's actions. Linick testified to the House Foreign Affairs and House Oversight and Government Reform committees last month, leading the panels to request interviews with Bulatao and the other aides.\nBulatao had been slated to appear on July 2, but Democrats deferred to a State Department request for a delay on the eve of his testimony, citing the need to review the recently completed inspector general's report on the Saudi arms sale. Democrats also agreed to postpone the other witness depositions until after Bulatao's appearance, but by Monday their patience had run out.\nIn a required letter to Congress after removing Linick, Trump said he had lost confidence in the department's watchdog. But when pressed directly, Trump said he removed Linick at Pompeo's request and knew little about the details of the inspector general's work. State Department aides have pushed back on suggestions that Pompeo or Bulatao acted improperly, alleging that Linick himself was the one acting improperly. Pompeo recently told reporters Linick was a \u201dbad actor\u201d in the department and wasn't adequately fulfilling the role of IG.\nThe State Department blasted the subpoenas in a lengthy statement, calling claims of stonewalling \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\u201cThe Department has been offering good faith proposals to satisfy their oversight inquiry since May 28, 2020,\u201d a department spokesperson said. \u201cRelated to this inquiry regarding Steve Linick, we have offered a briefing, an open hearing before both House Committees with the Under Secretary for Management, a briefing for Members on the Office of the Inspector General\u2019s review of the implementation of the Arms Export Control Act, and we have provided a very clear path for every individual requested to engage with the Committees. All of the offers have been rejected, manipulated by the Committees, or outright ignored.\u201d\nThe escalation between the committees and the State Department follows what had seemed to be a breakthrough last week, when Pompeo's executive secretary, Lisa Kenna, told senators she would commit to appearing before investigators on Aug. 7, part of a package deal with other witnesses involved in the probe. That agreement marked a resumption of tensions between the State Department and the Democrat-led House, which subpoenaed documents from the department amid its impeachment probe but ultimately received none.\nIn their statement announcing the subpoenas, Engel and Maloney indicated they had secured testimony from a senior State official voluntarily. That official, Charles Faulker, described String's role in the Saudi arms deal, suggesting String helped develop the legal rationale for declaring an emergency that allowed the $8 billion sale to proceed without required congressional approvals.\n\u201dAccording to Mr. Faulkner, Mr. String cited 'rising tensions' in a 'decades-long' conflict among Gulf powers as a basis for such an emergency transfer,\u201d the committees indicated.\nLast week, Engel subpoenaed Pompeo to produce another set of documents: those the State Department had already shared with Senate Republicans investigating Joe Biden's relationship with Ukraine, part of what Democrats say is a smear campaign that amplifies disinformation about Biden's role in leading diplomacy with a crucial European partner.\nThe strained relationship between Linick and Bulatao is at the heart of the committee's investigation. Bulatao told the committee that Linick botched an investigation into his own office's handling of a sensitive report about political retaliation inside the State Department, which leaked to the media ahead of its release. Linick was cleared in that probe by Pentagon watchdog Glenn Fine, whom Linick had asked to conduct the review.\nLinick told lawmakers he faced pressure to stop probing the Saudi arms sale, which Pompeo allies said was a policy dispute rather than a question of management. Linick said his response was that he was investigating the implementation of the policy, which is within the inspector general's scope. Linick also emphasized that Bulatao was among a small inner circle of Pompeo aides who were informed of his ongoing probe of Pompeo's use of government resources.\nLinick was also investigating the role Pompeo's wife, Susan Pompeo, played at the department and whether she and her husband improperly used State Department staffers to run personal errands for them.",
            "Congressional Democrats on Monday subpoenaed four aides to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as part of their bicameral investigation into the State Department's firing of its inspector general earlier this year.\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel of New York, House Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney, also of New York, and Senate Foreign Relations Ranking Member Bob Menendez, of New Jersey, announced the subpoenas compelling four Pompeo aides to testify as part of their joint investigation into the firing of former State Department Inspector General Steve Linick.\nGRASSLEY ASKS TRUMP FOR 'EXPLANATION' ON FIRING OF TOP STATE DEPT. WATCHDOG TO ENSURE IT'S NOT FOR 'POLITICAL REASONS'\n\u201dThe Administration continues to cover up the real reasons for Mr. Linick's firing by stonewalling the Committees' investigation and refusing to engage in good faith,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201dThat stonewalling has made today's subpoenas necessary, and the Committees will continue to pursue this investigation to uncover the truth that the American people deserve.\u201d\nThe subpoenas were directed to Under Secretary of State for Management Brian Bulatao, acting State Department Legal Adviser Mark String, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Michael Miller, and Pompeo's senior adviser, Toni Porter.\nThe subpoenas come as the committees investigate why President Trump fired Linick from his post.\nLinick, at the time of his firing, had been investigating the State Department's $7 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia, despite congressional objections. Linick also was probing whether Pompeo misused department funds for personal errands such as walking his dog, making dinner reservations and picking up his dry cleaning.\nLinick defended his work as \u201dimpartial\u201d and \u201dwithout regard to politics,\u201d during his closed-door testimony on Capitol Hill in June.\nFIRED STATE DEPARTMENT IG DEFENDS ROLE\nLinick's removal continued a series of changes among the government's inspectors general. The most notable was Trump's April firing of Inspector General for the Intelligence Community Michael Atkinson, who played a role in handling the whistleblower complaint that led to the Ukraine probe -- and Trump's subsequent impeachment.\nMeanwhile, the Democrats also announced Monday that State Department Executive Secretary Lisa Kenney, during her Senate confirmation hearing to be U.S. Ambassador to Peru, committed to appear for a staff-led, transcribed interview conducted by the three committees on Aug. 7.\nThey also released highlights of an interview they conducted with former State Department official Charles Faulkner.\n\u201dWe thank Mr. Faulkner for appearing voluntarily last week. His testimony raises additional questions about the Administration's decision to sell arms to Saudi Arabia and the UAE under a spurious 'emergency declaration' in 2019 \u2013 questions that we understand the State Department Inspector General's office sought answers to prior to Mr. Linick's firing,\u201d they wrote, adding that his testimony \u201ddepicts a small group of senior State Department officials determined to ignore legitimate humanitarian concerns among their ranks and on Capitol Hill in order to ram through more than $8 billion in arms sales to Gulf countries.\u201d\nThe committee added that Faulkner \u201dpresented a timeline for these events that refutes a senior official's testimony to Congress about when these decisions were made.\u201d\nThe Democrats committed to releasing the full transcript of Faulkner's interview \u201das soon as possible.\u201d\nFox News' Jason Donner contributed to this report."

Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a joint statement. \u201dThat stonewalling has made today\u2019s subpoenas necessary.\u201d Bulatao is seen by Democrats as a linchpin in their investigation, an enforcer of sorts for Pompeo who Linick said attempted to bully him into shying away from sensitive investigations about Pompeo's use of taxpayer resources and stewardship of an arms sale to Saudi Arabia. The other aides, Democrats say, were aware of the circumstances of Linick's departure or of the two investigations that he said raised questions about Pompeo's actions. Linick testified to the House Foreign Affairs and House Oversight and Government Reform committees last month, leading the panels to request interviews with Bulatao and the other aides. Bulatao had been slated to appear on July 2, but Democrats deferred to a State Department request for a delay on the eve of his testimony, citing the need to review the recently completed inspector general's report on the Saudi arms sale. Democrats also agreed to postpone the other witness depositions until after Bulatao's appearance, but by Monday their patience had run out. In a required letter to Congress after removing Linick, Trump said he had lost confidence in the department's watchdog. But when pressed directly, Trump said he removed Linick at Pompeo's request and knew little about the details of the inspector general's work. State Department aides have pushed back on suggestions that Pompeo or Bulatao acted improperly, alleging that Linick himself was the one acting improperly. Pompeo recently told reporters Linick was a \u201dbad actor\u201d in the department and wasn't adequately fulfilling the role of IG. The State Department blasted the subpoenas in a lengthy statement, calling claims of stonewalling \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cThe Department has been offering good faith proposals to satisfy their oversight inquiry since May 28, 2020,\u201d a department spokesperson said. \u201cRelated to this inquiry regarding Steve Linick, we have offered a briefing, an open hearing before both House Committees with the Under Secretary for Management, a briefing for Members on the Office of the Inspector General\u2019s review of the implementation of the Arms Export Control Act, and we have provided a very clear path for every individual requested to engage with the Committees. All of the offers have been rejected, manipulated by the Committees, or outright ignored.\u201d The escalation between the committees and the State Department follows what had seemed to be a breakthrough last week, when Pompeo's executive secretary, Lisa Kenna, told senators she would commit to appearing before investigators on Aug. 7, part of a package deal with other witnesses involved in the probe. That agreement marked a resumption of tensions between the State Department and the Democrat-led House, which subpoenaed documents from the department amid its impeachment probe but ultimately received none. In their statement announcing the subpoenas, Engel and Maloney indicated they had secured testimony from a senior State official voluntarily. That official, Charles Faulker, described String's role in the Saudi arms deal, suggesting String helped develop the legal rationale for declaring an emergency that allowed the $8 billion sale to proceed without required congressional approvals. \u201dAccording to Mr. Faulkner, Mr. String cited 'rising tensions' in a 'decades-long' conflict among Gulf powers as a basis for such an emergency transfer,\u201d the committees indicated. Last week, Engel subpoenaed Pompeo to produce another set of documents: those the State Department had already shared with Senate Republicans investigating Joe Biden's relationship with Ukraine, part of what Democrats say is a smear campaign that amplifies disinformation about Biden's role in leading diplomacy with a crucial European partner. The strained relationship between Linick and Bulatao is at the heart of the committee's investigation. Bulatao told the committee that Linick botched an investigation into his own office's handling of a sensitive report about political retaliation inside the State Department, which leaked to the media ahead of its release. Linick was cleared in that probe by Pentagon watchdog Glenn Fine, whom Linick had asked to conduct the review. Linick told lawmakers he faced pressure to stop probing the Saudi arms sale, which Pompeo allies said was a policy dispute rather than a question of management. Linick said his response was that he was investigating the implementation of the policy, which is within the inspector general's scope. Linick also emphasized that Bulatao was among a small inner circle of Pompeo aides who were informed of his ongoing probe of Pompeo's use of government resources. Linick was also investigating the role Pompeo's wife, Susan Pompeo, played at the department and whether she and her husband improperly used State Department staffers to run personal errands for them.",
        "summarized_context": "House Democrats have issued subpoenas to four senior aides of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as part of their investigation into the firing of State Department Inspector General Steve Linick. The subpoenas were issued by House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel and accuse the aides of resisting interviews. The State Department has been accused of stonewalling the investigation, prompting the subpoenas. The investigation is focused on the circumstances surrounding Linick's firing, including allegations that Pompeo attempted to bully him into avoiding sensitive investigations. The State Department has criticized the subpoenas, calling claims of stonewalling \"outrageous.\""

            "\u00a9 Jeenah Moon/Getty Images\nA Manhattan prosecutor\u2019s investigation into President Donald Trump\u2019s finances goes beyond \u2018hush money\u2019 payments during the 2016 campaign and includes allegations of bank and insurance fraud, according to a court filing Monday.\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. emphasized the broad scope of the grand jury investigation as he battles to get access to eight years of financial records related to Trump and his business empire.\nA grand jury subpoenaed that information last fall, but Trump filed a federal lawsuit to block the subpoena and unsuccessfully pressed the challenge all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nLast month, the justices unanimously rejected Trump\u2019s bold claim that \u2014 for as long as he serves as president \u2014 records about him are absolutely immune from demands by state or local prosecutors.\nHowever, the Supreme Court said Trump can challenge the subpoena on other grounds. His attorneys did so last week, arguing that the subpoena to Trump\u2019s accounting firm Mazars sweeps too broadly.\n\u00a9 AP Photo/Patrick Semansky A police officer walks outside the Supreme Court on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.\nIn Vance's filing Monday with U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marrero, the prosecutor rebutted that argument by noting that his office submitted a largely-secret declaration to the judge last year indicating that the New York probe is examining a wide array of matters related to the Trump organization and not solely the admission by longtime Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen that he orchestrated \u2018hush money\u2019 payments during the 2016 campaign to women claiming they had sexual encounters with Trump.\n\u201dPlaintiff\u2019s argument that the Mazars Subpoena is overbroad fails for the additional reason that it rests on the false premise that the grand jury\u2019s investigation is limited to so-called 'hush-money' payments made by Michael Cohen on behalf of Plaintiff in 2016,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cThis Court is already aware that this assertion is fatally undermined by undisputed information in the public record.\u201d\nVance\u2019s filing goes on to note that in a court opinion last October, Marrero noted that the subpoenaed information could be of use in examining claims of \u201calleged insurance and bank fraud by the Trump Organization and its officers.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s submission also cites news articles alleging that Trump routinely used various schemes to inflate the value of his assets when obtaining loans and diminish those values when paying taxes.\nThe litigation before Marrero now seems to have evolved into an intense race against the election clock, although Vance\u2019s office is careful not to discuss it in those terms and simply to refer to the urgency of the investigation. If the prosecutor can obtain the tax and other financial records weeks or longer before Election Day, he could obtain indictments that might be politically damaging, regardless of whether the president himself is named as a defendant.\nBut if the litigation drags on, Vance may not be able to make any dramatic steps before early November.\nAt a telephone hearing last month, Marrero said he was inclined to move the court fight along even faster than the two sides had agreed to. However, he eventually agreed to that schedule, which contemplates another submission from Trump\u2019s attorneys on Aug. 14. The judge could rule soon after that time based on the parties\u2019 written arguments, or he could call a hearing to discuss the issues further.",
            "New Filing Suggests Manhattan DA Investigating \u2018Protracted Criminal Conduct at the Trump Organization\u2019\nThe Manhattan district attorney suggested that the office\u2019s subpoena for President Donald Trump\u2019s financial records is part of an investigation into \u201cpossibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization\u201d that was alleged in media reports in recent years, according to a new court filing.\nThe office of New York Country District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. told the court on Monday that publicly available information about the Trump organization and its officers, which includes allegations of insurance and bank fraud, provides a legal basis for requesting the substantial amount of financial records from the president\u2019s accounting firm, Mazars USA.\n\u201cIn light of these public reports of possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization, there was nothing facially improper (or even particularly unusual) about the Mazars Subpoena, which issued in connection with a complex financial investigation, requesting eight years of records from an accounting firm,\u201d the office wrote (pdf).\nThe district attorney made the argument in a filing responding to Trump\u2019s new challenge against the prosecutor\u2019s subpoena seeking the president\u2019s tax returns as part of a grand jury probe.\nThe president\u2019s lawyers argued in their second amended complaint that Vance\u2019s subpoena was \u201cwidely overbroad\u201d and issued in \u201cbad faith,\u201d which amounted to a form of \u201charassment\u201d against the president.\nWhen the subpoena was issued, Vance was reportedly investigating hush money allegedly paid to two women during the 2016 presidential campaign: adult film performer Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Trump has denied any wrongdoing in connection with the two women.\nMonday\u2019s filing suggests that the scope of Vance\u2019s investigation is more expansive than the prosecutor had previously acknowledged.\nIn a footnote, the district attorney pointed to three media reports published in 2018 and 2019 about the president\u2019s wealth and finances to justify its subpoena. The reports alleged wrongdoing by Trump and his organization to expand his businesses including illegally inflating his worth to prospective lenders and investors.\n\u201cPublic reporting demonstrates that the Office had a valid basis for requesting each category and timeframe of document listed in the Mazars Subpoena,\u201d the district attorney office argued.\n\u201cThese reports describe transactions involving individual and corporate actors based in New York County, but whose conduct at times extended beyond New York\u2019s borders. This possible criminal activity occurred within the applicable statutes of limitations, particularly if the transactions involved a continuing pattern of conduct.\u201d\nTrump has been fighting Vance\u2019s subpoena since September 2019, arguing that the president enjoys absolute immunity from state criminal process under the Constitution. The district court denied Trump\u2019s application for an injunction over the subpoena and dismissed the case in October 2019. The 2nd Circuit also denied the president\u2019s request for relief.\nTrump\u2019s lawyer argued in the Supreme Court that a sitting president has absolute immunity from state criminal subpoenas because compliance with them would impair the performance of his presidential duties. The federal government, which was also involved in the case, argued that a state grand jury subpoena for personal records of a sitting president should meet a higher standard of need.\nThe Supreme Court on July 9 pushed back (pdf) on both arguments and said \u201cno citizen, not even the President, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding.\u201d However, the top court left the door open for the president to seek recourse, suggesting that Trump could still challenge the subpoena on other grounds.\nIn Trump\u2019s filing in late July, his lawyers argued that the scope of the subpoena was overbroad as it requested for \u201cvoluminous documents\u201d beyond the district attorney\u2019s limited jurisdiction under New York law and was not properly tailored for Trump\u2019s records. They argued this was because Vance had copied the wording of subpoenas issued by House Committees also seeking the president\u2019s financial records.\nThey also argued that the extensive nature of the subpoena also suggest that Vance had issued the subpoena in bad faith.\nVance\u2019s office argued that Trump\u2019s challenge should be tossed out as it fails to establish overbreadth or bad faith and does not state a claim.\nTrump\u2019s lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Epoch Times."

        "context": "WILMINGTON, Del./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Joe Biden will get the coronavirus vaccine as soon as next week, transition officials said on Wednesday, as U.S. authorities try to build public confidence in a measure that promises to stanch the deadly pandemic. Vice President Mike Pence will get the vaccine on Friday, the White House said. Both men will receive the shot publicly in an effort to boost confidence in the safety of the vaccine, which will become widely available to the public next year. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get ahead of the line but I want to make sure that we demonstrate to the American people that it is safe to take,\u201d Biden said at an event earlier on Wednesday. Biden, 78, is in a high-risk category for the coronavirus because of his age. Biden has vowed to make the fight against the virus his top priority when he takes office on Jan. 20. President Donald Trump, who lost the Nov. 3 election to Biden, has frequently downplayed the severity of the pandemic, which has killed 304,187 Americans so far, and feuded with his top public health officials. Trump will get the vaccine himself as soon as his medical team determines it is best, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Tuesday. The president was hospitalized after testing positive for COVID-19 this fall. Initial doses of the vaccine, which became available in the United States this week, have been set aside for doctors, nurses and other frontline medical workers, along with residents and staff of nursing homes and some U.S. government officials. U.S. officials aim to get 2.9 million doses of the vaccine, developed by Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE, by week\u2019s end. One health worker in Alaska had a severe allergic reaction after receiving the vaccine, officials said on Wednesday in what is believed to be the only adverse reaction so far in the United States. FILE PHOTO: Doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine are ready to be administered at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., December 16, 2020. REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo A significant portion of the American public has shown disdain for basic public health recommendations, such as wearing a mask, and only 61% of respondents in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll said they were open to getting vaccinated. Scientists believe that \u201cherd immunity\u201d against the virus could be achieved once about 70% of the population has been exposed to it, either through natural infection or a vaccine. Some 16.7 million Americans have been infected so far, equal to roughly 5% of the population. Pence\u2019s wife, Karen, and Surgeon General Jerome Adams also will get the vaccine on Friday, the White House said. Biden\u2019s transition team did not say when Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would get the vaccine. \u2018U.S. SHOULD LEAD THE WAY\u2019 Biden is building his incoming administration as he prepares for his inauguration next month. On Wednesday, he introduced former presidential rival Pete Buttigieg as his choice for U.S. transportation secretary to take the lead in upgrading America\u2019s aging infrastructure. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, would be the first openly gay Cabinet secretary confirmed by the Senate if he is approved. \u201cThe Biden-Harris Cabinet will be a historic Cabinet - a Cabinet that looks like America, a Cabinet that taps into the best of America, a Cabinet that is opening doors and breaking down barriers and accessing the full range of talent ... in this nation,\u201d Biden said as he puts forth what is shaping up to be the most diverse Cabinet in U.S. history. Appearing with Buttigieg in Wilmington, Delaware, Biden said the 38-year-old would confront the task of restoring what he called \u201cour crumbling roads, bridges and ports.\u201d Biden has proposed a massive boost in infrastructure spending. Buttigieg emerged from relative obscurity to mount a surprisingly robust campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination eventually won by Biden. A military veteran who served in Afghanistan, Buttigieg is in the vanguard of the next generation of Democratic politicians and is widely seen as a future presidential contender. \u201cAmericans shouldn\u2019t settle for less than our peers in the developed world when it comes to our roads and bridges, our railways and transit systems. The U.S. should lead the way, and I know that in this administration we will,\u201d Buttigieg said.",
        "summarized_context": "Vice President Mike Pence and President-elect Joe Biden are both set to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the coming days. Pence and his wife will receive the vaccine publicly at the White House to promote its safety and efficacy. Surgeon General Jerome Adams will also receive the vaccine alongside them. Biden is expected to receive the vaccine next week. The announcements come after healthcare workers across the US began receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine earlier this week. President Donald Trump has not announced plans to take the vaccine yet. Former Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton have expressed willingness to take the vaccine publicly."

            "\u00a9 Provided by Metro\n\u00a9 Provided by Metro\nSALT LAKE CITY (Reuters) \u2013 Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic challenger Kamala Harris clashed over the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic during their debate on Wednesday, as the White House struggled to contain an outbreak that has infected President Donald Trump and dozens of others.\nThe policy-heavy, relatively sedate debate stood in stark contrast to last week\u2019s chaotic presidential showdown between Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, which was marred by Trump\u2019s constant interruptions and personal insults from both men.\nTrump\u2019s COVID-19 diagnosis, along with his age and that of Biden, added weight to the debate, as both Pence, 61, and Harris, 55, sought to demonstrate they were capable of assuming the office if needed. Either the Republican Trump, 74, or Biden, 77, would be the oldest U.S president to be sworn into office if victorious in November.\nBut Wednesday\u2019s confrontation seemed unlikely to alter the dynamics of a race that opinion polls show Biden is winning with less than four weeks to the Nov. 3 election, as both candidates evaded certain questions, stuck to talking points and avoided major gaffes.\nHarris, the California U.S. senator and former state attorney general, immediately went after Trump\u2019s record on the pandemic that has claimed 210,000 American lives and devastated the economy.\n\u201cThe American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,\u201d Harris said as the debate began at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.\nIn response, Pence blamed China for the pandemic and touted the U.S. administration\u2019s efforts to battle the disease, including Trump\u2019s decision in late January to restrict travel from the pandemic\u2019s epicenter in China.\n\u201cI want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of America first,\u201d he said. \u201cChina is to blame for the coronavirus, and President Trump is not happy about it,\u201d he added.\nThe two candidates were separated by 12 feet (3.6 meters) and plexiglass shields, a reminder of the virus that has led to the largest public health crisis in a century.\nHarris, who made her own unsuccessful run for the presidency, faced enormous pressure as she took the biggest political stage of her life. On Wednesday, she largely succeeded at fulfilling the running mate\u2019s traditional attack role.\nPence delivered the kind of calm, reasoned points that the combative Trump rarely offers, but the president\u2019s propensity for grabbing headlines is likely to overshadow his second-in-command\u2019s performance almost immediately.\nMASKS AND SOCIAL DISTANCING\nPence was questioned about the administration\u2019s White House event last month announcing Trump\u2019s latest Supreme Court nomination, where masks and social distancing were mostly absent. A number of prominent attendees, including the president himself, have since tested positive for COVID-19.\nThe vice president noted that the event was outdoors before criticizing Harris and Biden, who have promised to mandate masks on federal property and encourage the practice nationwide, for not respecting people\u2019s freedom to make their own choices on health.\n\u201cYou respect the American people when you tell them the truth,\u201d Harris retorted, noting that Trump played down the virus for months.\nHarris faulted the Trump administration for trying to invalidate the Affordable Care Act (ACA) healthcare law in the midst of a pandemic and assailing Trump for reportedly paying $750 a year in federal income taxes as president.\n\u201cWhen I first heard about it, I literally said, \u2018You mean $750,000?'\u201d Harris said, referring to a New York Times investigation. \u201cAnd it was like, \u2018No \u2013 $750.'\u201d\nShe also warned that the Trump administration\u2019s challenge to the ACA would enable insurance companies to deny coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions: \u201cIf you love someone who has a pre-existing condition, they\u2019re coming for you.\u201d\nPence called the ACA, popularly known as Obamacare, a \u201cdisaster.\u201d\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments over the law a week after the election. Republicans are working to seat Trump\u2019s conservative nominee to the court, Amy Coney Barrett, by month\u2019s end over the objections of Democrats.\nTAX BATTLE\nPence sought to counter Harris\u2019s attacks by turning the focus to the economy and tax policy, saying: \u201cOn Day One, Joe Biden\u2019s going to raise your taxes.\u201d Harris responded by saying that Biden has vowed not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year.\nThe vice president also asserted that Biden would ban fracking and embrace the Green New Deal, a massive environmental proposal backed by liberal Democrats. Biden, however, has rejected both of those positions.\nAsked about a potential vaccine, Harris said she would only trust the word of scientists, rather than that of Trump, who has promoted unproven treatments in the past.\n\u201cIf the doctors tell us that we should take it, I\u2019ll be the first in line to take it, absolutely,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if Donald Trump tells us to take it, I\u2019m not taking it.\u201d\nPence fired back, accusing Harris of undermining public confidence in vaccines. \u201cI think it is unconscionable,\u201d he said. \u201cStop playing politics with people\u2019s lives.\u201d\nRACE AN ISSUEHarris, the first Black woman to serve on a major-party presidential ticket, also attacked Pence on race relations, criticizing Trump for turning down an opportunity to denounce white supremacists at last week\u2019s debate with Biden.\nIn response, Pence accused the media of taking Trump\u2019s words out of context and said the president had repeatedly disavowed racist groups.\nBiden leads Trump in national opinion polls and has an advantage of 12 percentage points in the latest Reuters/Ipsos survey of likely voters. Polls show the race to be closer in some of the election battleground states that could determine the winner, although a Reuters/Ipsos poll on Wednesday showed Biden leading Trump in pivotal Florida.\nHarris, who was on the biggest stage of her political career, is the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India and the first person of Asian descent on a major-party presidential ticket, as well as the first Black woman.\nPence, a former conservative radio host, is a former U.S. congressman and Indiana governor who has steadfastly defended Trump during his tumultuous presidency.\nIn addition to competing for November\u2019s election, the two candidates were also jockeying for long-term position in their respective parties. Both are widely seen as future presidential candidates, whatever the outcome of November\u2019s contest.\nIt was the only vice presidential debate of the campaign. Biden and Trump are due for a rematch on Oct. 15 and 22.\n(Reporting by Michael Martina in Salt Lake City and Joseph Ax in Princeton, New Jersey; Additional reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt, Doina Chiacu, Jason Lange and Alexandra Alper; Editing by Soyoung Kim and Howard Goller)",

        "context": "SALT LAKE CITY (Reuters) - Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic challenger Kamala Harris clashed over the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic during their debate on Wednesday, as the White House struggled to contain an outbreak that has infected President Donald Trump and dozens of others. The policy-heavy, relatively sedate debate stood in stark contrast to last week\u2019s chaotic presidential showdown between Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, which was marred by Trump\u2019s constant interruptions and personal insults from both men. Trump\u2019s COVID-19 diagnosis, along with his age and that of Biden, added weight to the debate, as both Pence, 61, and Harris, 55, sought to demonstrate they were capable of assuming the office if needed. Either the Republican Trump, 74, or Biden, 77, would be the oldest U.S president to be sworn into office if victorious in November. But Wednesday\u2019s confrontation seemed unlikely to alter the dynamics of a race that opinion polls show Biden is winning with less than four weeks to the Nov. 3 election, as both candidates evaded certain questions, stuck to talking points and avoided major gaffes. Harris, the California U.S. senator and former state attorney general, immediately went after Trump\u2019s record on the pandemic that has claimed 210,000 American lives and devastated the economy. \u201cThe American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,\u201d Harris said as the debate began at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. In response, Pence blamed China for the pandemic and touted the U.S. administration\u2019s efforts to battle the disease, including Trump\u2019s decision in late January to restrict travel from the pandemic\u2019s epicenter in China. \u201cI want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of America first,\u201d he said. \u201cChina is to blame for the coronavirus, and President Trump is not happy about it,\u201d he added. The two candidates were separated by 12 feet (3.6 meters) and plexiglass shields, a reminder of the virus that has led to the largest public health crisis in a century. Harris, who made her own unsuccessful run for the presidency, faced enormous pressure as she took the biggest political stage of her life. On Wednesday, she largely succeeded at fulfilling the running mate\u2019s traditional attack role. Pence delivered the kind of calm, reasoned points that the combative Trump rarely offers, but the president\u2019s propensity for grabbing headlines is likely to overshadow his second-in-command\u2019s performance almost immediately. MASKS AND SOCIAL DISTANCING Pence was questioned about the administration\u2019s White House event last month announcing Trump\u2019s latest Supreme Court nomination, where masks and social distancing were mostly absent. A number of prominent attendees, including the president himself, have since tested positive for COVID-19. The vice president noted that the event was outdoors before criticizing Harris and Biden, who have promised to mandate masks on federal property and encourage the practice nationwide, for not respecting people\u2019s freedom to make their own choices on health. \u201cYou respect the American people when you tell them the truth,\u201d Harris retorted, noting that Trump played down the virus for months. Harris faulted the Trump administration for trying to invalidate the Affordable Care Act (ACA) healthcare law in the midst of a pandemic and assailing Trump for reportedly paying $750 a year in federal income taxes as president. \u201cWhen I first heard about it, I literally said, \u2018You mean $750,000?\u2019\u201d Harris said, referring to a New York Times investigation. \u201cAnd it was like, \u2018No - $750.\u2019\u201d Slideshow ( 5 images ) She also warned that the Trump administration\u2019s challenge to the ACA would enable insurance companies to deny coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions: \u201cIf you love someone who has a pre-existing condition, they\u2019re coming for you.\u201d Pence called the ACA, popularly known as Obamacare, a \u201cdisaster.\u201d The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments over the law a week after the election. Republicans are working to seat Trump\u2019s conservative nominee to the court, Amy Coney Barrett, by month\u2019s end over the objections of Democrats. Slideshow ( 5 images ) TAX BATTLE Pence sought to counter Harris\u2019s attacks by turning the focus to the economy and tax policy, saying: \u201cOn Day One, Joe Biden\u2019s going to raise your taxes.\u201d Harris responded by saying that Biden has vowed not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. The vice president also asserted that Biden would ban fracking and embrace the Green New Deal, a massive environmental proposal backed by liberal Democrats. Biden, however, has rejected both of those positions. Asked about a potential vaccine, Harris said she would only trust the word of scientists, rather than that of Trump, who has promoted unproven treatments in the past. \u201cIf the doctors tell us that we should take it, I\u2019ll be the first in line to take it, absolutely,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if Donald Trump tells us to take it, I\u2019m not taking it.\u201d Pence fired back, accusing Harris of undermining public confidence in vaccines. \u201cI think it is unconscionable,\u201d he said. \u201cStop playing politics with people\u2019s lives.\u201d RACE AN ISSUEHarris, the first Black woman to serve on a major-party presidential ticket, also attacked Pence on race relations, criticizing Trump for turning down an opportunity to denounce white supremacists at last week\u2019s debate with Biden. In response, Pence accused the media of taking Trump\u2019s words out of context and said the president had repeatedly disavowed racist groups. Biden leads Trump in national opinion polls and has an advantage of 12 percentage points in the latest Reuters/Ipsos survey of likely voters. Polls show the race to be closer in some of the election battleground states that could determine the winner, although a Reuters/Ipsos poll on Wednesday showed Biden leading Trump in pivotal Florida. Harris, who was on the biggest stage of her political career, is the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India and the first person of Asian descent on a major-party presidential ticket, as well as the first Black woman. Pence, a former conservative radio host, is a former U.S. congressman and Indiana governor who has steadfastly defended Trump during his tumultuous presidency. In addition to competing for November\u2019s election, the two candidates were also jockeying for long-term position in their respective parties. Both are widely seen as future presidential candidates, whatever the outcome of November\u2019s contest. It was the only vice presidential debate of the campaign. Biden and Trump are due for a rematch on Oct. 15 and 22.",
        "summarized_context": "Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic challenger Kamala Harris engaged in a policy-heavy and relatively sedate debate, discussing the Trump administration's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Pence defended the administration's efforts and blamed China for the outbreak, while Harris criticized Trump's record on the pandemic and accused him of downplaying the virus. The candidates also discussed healthcare, taxes, race relations, and a potential vaccine. The debate is unlikely to significantly impact the race, as polls show Biden leading Trump with less than four weeks until the election. Both Pence and Harris are seen as potential future presidential candidates."

            "President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump have tested positive for Covid-19, and both are reportedly experiencing mild symptoms of the disease \u2014 a development with huge but unclear ramifications for the presidential race and for the United States\u2019 ongoing, deadly coronavirus pandemic.\n\u201cTonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!\u201d the president tweeted early Friday.\nThe New York Times\u2019s Maggie Haberman reported Friday that Trump has \u201ccold-like symptoms\u201d and seemed \u201clethargic\u201d at an event he attended in New Jersey on Thursday. The first lady tweeted Friday morning that she was experiencing \u201cmild symptoms\u201d as well.\nIt\u2019s not clear who exposed the president and when. But Jennifer Jacobs of Bloomberg News reported Thursday evening that counselor to the president Hope Hicks had tested positive and was experiencing symptoms. Hicks has been traveling with President Trump and other White House staff in recent days, including to the debate in Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday and to Minnesota for a fundraiser and rally Wednesday.\nThe White House released a memo early Friday from Sean Conley, physician to the president, stating that \u201cthe President and First Lady are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence.\u201d Conley added: \u201cRest assured I expect the President to continue carrying out his duties while recovering.\u201d\nThe \u201cOctober surprise\u201d\nThe implications for the presidential campaign \u2014 and, really, the country \u2014 are unclear at this point. Observers have been expecting an \u201cOctober surprise\u201d \u2014 the term for an unforeseeable event that throws an election into chaos \u2014 and the arrival of Covid-19 in the Oval Office may be it.\nWhat happens in the coming days and weeks depends on how serious a case the 74-year-old president has. The coronavirus is particularly dangerous for older people: A person\u2019s risk of hospitalization and death increases with every passing decade. Neither Trump nor his physician has mentioned whether he is displaying symptoms, though Conley said he is \u201cwell.\u201d\nRallies are out for the foreseeable future, and it\u2019s unclear whether the president will be able to attend the next debate on October 15.\nIf Trump\u2019s case were to worsen to the point of incapacitation, it would be possible for the vice president and a majority of sitting Cabinet secretaries to invoke the Constitution\u2019s 25th Amendment \u2014 making Mike Pence the acting president. But of course, Trump could also have a mild case and recover well before such a measure would be necessary.\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s debate, Trump mocked former Vice President Joe Biden for wearing masks. \u201dI don\u2019t wear masks like him. Every time you see him, he\u2019s got a mask,\u201d Trump said. More broadly, the president has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the pandemic, holding packed campaign gatherings and arguing that the country needs to return to normal. The problem, though, was that the virus never went away \u2014 as Trump has now learned firsthand.\nTo date, 7.3 million Americans have been diagnosed with the virus and at least 208,000 have died.\nThere have been multiple cases of coronavirus around Trump\nVice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, has tested negative for coronavirus, his campaign said Friday. Biden and Trump shared a stage, maskless, at Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate. (A negative test doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he\u2019s free and clear of the disease; it can take several days after exposure for some people to test positive, and some show symptoms but never test positive at all.)\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether Trump and his entourage exposed members of the public to the virus. According to the Washington Post, \u201cAfter White House officials learned of Hicks\u2019 symptoms, Trump and his entourage flew to New Jersey, where he attended a fundraiser and delivered a speech. Trump was in close contact with dozens of other people, including campaign supporters at a roundtable event.\u201d\nWhile Trump, as well as aides and reporters in close contact with him, are regularly tested for the virus, mask-wearing isn\u2019t mandated and temperature screenings for visitors to the White House were rolled back in July.\nAlready, there have been several known cases of coronavirus infection around Trump \u2014 most recently, at least 11 members of the Secret Service and his national security adviser, Robert C. O\u2019Brien, according to the New York Times.\nTrump also isn\u2019t the first world leader to test positive. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil both contracted Covid-19 and recovered. Johnson\u2019s case was particularly severe. During his illness, he spent several days in the intensive care unit, and had doctors standing by preparing to inform the world about his death.\nHelp keep Vox free for all\nMillions turn to Vox each month to understand what\u2019s happening in the news, from the coronavirus crisis to a racial reckoning to what is, quite possibly, the most consequential presidential election of our lifetimes.

            "President Trump tested positive for the coronavirus early Friday morning, throwing the state of the 2020 presidential campaign and potentially much more in Washington into question.\nThe president announced his diagnosis in a tweet and said that he and first lady Melania Trump, who also tested positive, would quarantine together.\n\u201dTonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!\u201d Trump said.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP, FIRST LADY TEST POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS, SET TO QUARANTINE AT WHITE HOUSE\nThe president's positive test came after close aide Hope Hicks also tested positive.\nTrump, 74, is reportedly not experiencing symptoms as of Friday morning. Given his age, the president is most at risk from getting ill, but the vast majority of people in his group still recover from the virus. Additionally, other White House staffers in the past have tested positive for the virus, including an aide to Vice President Pence and national security adviser Robert O'Brien.\nHere is a timeline of developments around the president's coronavirus diagnosis.\nTuesday\nPence was with Trump in the Oval Office on Tuesday morning.

And when they come over to you, it's hard to say, 'stay back, stay back.' You know, it's a tough kind of a situation, it's a terrible thing... I just went for a test, and we'll see what happens. I mean, who knows ... I was surprised to hear with Hope.\u201d\nAt 10:44 p.m. Trump posted a tweet about Hicks' test.\n\u201dHope Hicks, who has been working so hard without even taking a small break, has just tested positive for Covid 19.

            "\u00a9 Provided by Boston Herald President Donald Trump gives a thumbs-up as he leaves the White House to go to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center after he tested positive for COVID-19, Friday, Oct. 2, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\nWith a thumbs-up and a wave, a masked President Trump boarded Marine One en route to Walter Reed military hospital Friday evening to continue his battle against the novel coronavirus \u2014 his sudden diagnosis raising more uncertainty with the election just a month away.\nThe president and first lady Melania Trump have both tested positive for COVID-19, a stunning development Trump announced in a tweet shortly before 1 a.m. Friday, triggering an outpouring of well wishes and a chorus of pleas for continued vigilance against the highly contagious virus.\n\u201cI want to thank everybody for the tremendous support,\u201d Trump, 74, said in a video taped shortly before his departure from the White House. \u201cI think I\u2019m doing very well, but we\u2019re going to make sure things work out.\u201d\nThe president said the first lady \u2014 who tweeted earlier in the day that she was experiencing \u201cmild symptoms but overall feeling good\u201d \u2014 was \u201cdoing very well.\u201d\nTrump will spend \u201ca few days\u201d at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center as a precaution, the White House said, adding that he expects to continue work from the hospital\u2019s presidential suite.\nEarlier Friday, Trump was injected with an experimental antibody cocktail as a \u201cprecautionary measure,\u201d according to the White House physician, who said the president \u201cremains fatigued but in good spirits.\u201d He also reportedly had a fever.\nTrump\u2019s positive test came hours after he confirmed that Hope Hicks, one of his top aides, had contracted the virus on Thursday. Hicks began feeling symptoms on the plane ride home from a rally in Minnesota Wednesday, a day after traveling with the president and members of his family to the first debate in Cleveland. The president also traveled to New Jersey for a fundraiser Thursday, potentially exposing attendees there.\nThe president\u2019s diagnosis sent stock markets spinning and shockwaves reverberating across the globe as many in the nation awoke to the news that the first couple had tested positive for the virus that\u2019s killed more than 207,000 Americans and infected more than 7.2 million \u2014 a fact Trump has routinely downplayed as he\u2019s largely eschewed mask-wearing and continued to hold campaign rallies across the nation.\nTrump is off the campaign trail now, his criss-crossing of the country in an effort to catch Democratic nominee Joe Biden in the polls on hold as he quarantines. Before the president was taken to Walter Reed, his campaign said all events involving Trump and his family would go virtual or be temporarily postponed. Vice President Mike Pence, who has tested negative, will resume campaigning. The vice presidential debate scheduled for Oct. 7 is reportedly still on.\nI\u2019m happy to report that Jill and I have tested negative for COVID. Thank you to everyone for your messages of concern. I hope this serves as a reminder: wear a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands. \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 2, 2020\nBiden and his wife, Jill, both tested negative and returned to the campaign trail Friday in Michigan and New Hampshire, respectively, as both campaigns grappled with how to move forward in an unprecedented situation just more than 30 days before Election Day. Biden\u2019s campaign said it was pulling down negative ads.\n\u201cThis cannot be a partisan moment. It must be an American moment,\u201d Biden said in Michigan, offering prayers for the first family and calling their diagnosis, \u201ca bracing reminder to all of us that we have to take this virus seriously.\u201d\nBiden\u2019s warning echoed across the nation as health experts and politicians alike urged people to follow public health guidelines.\n\u201cNo one is safe,\u201d Boston Mayor Martin Walsh said. \u201cWear a god damn mask,\u201d tweeted U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy III.\nU.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a frequent Trump foe who lost one of her brothers to COVID-19, wished the first family a \u201cquick and safe recovery\u201d even as she chided the president for spending \u201cmonths undermining the work of our doctors and scientists.\u201d\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was among the Republicans \u2014 including U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney \u2014 offering thoughts and prayers.\nMcConnell pledged to go \u201cfull steam ahead\u201d with Supreme Court confirmation hearings for federal appeals court Judge Amy Coney Barrett. But questions abounded after two Republicans on the Senate Judiciary committee, Utah U.S. Sen. Mike Lee and U.S. Sen.

Trump \u201cremains fatigued,\u201d his doctor said.\nTrump was to depart the White House by helicopter late Friday for Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. The White House said the visit was precautionary and that he would work from the hospital\u2019s presidential suite, which is equipped to allow him to continue his official duties.\n\u201cPresident Trump remains in good spirts, has mild symptoms, and has been working throughout the day,\u201d said press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the president will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days.\u201d\nEarlier Friday the White House said Trump had been injected with an experimental antibody cocktail by the White House physician.\nBill Stepien, who heads Trump\u2019s reelection, said Vice President Mike Pence, who has tested negative for COVID-19, plans to continue to his campaign schedule.\nPresident Trump announced early Friday that he and first lady Melania Trump have tested positive for the coronavirus, a stunning announcement that plunges the country deeper into uncertainty just a month before the presidential election.\nTrump, who has spent much of the year downplaying the threat of a virus that has killed more than 205,000 Americans, said he and Mrs. Trump were quarantining. The White House physician said the president is expected to continue carrying out his duties \u201cwithout disruption\u201d while recovering.\nStill, Trump\u2019s diagnosis was sure to have a destabilizing effect in Washington and around the world, raising questions about how far the virus had spread through the highest levels of the U.S. government. Hours before Trump announced he had contracted the virus, the White House said a top aide who had traveled with him during the week had tested positive.\nVice President Mike Pence tested negative for the virus on Friday morning and \u201cremains in good health,\u201d his spokesman said.\nJoe Biden has tested negative for the coronavirus, his primary care doctor confirmed on Friday.\nThe Democratic presidential nominee and his wife were tested earlier in the day after news of President Trump\u2019s infection was announced.\nDr. Kevin O\u2019Connor released the negative results in a statement issued by the Biden campaign.\nBiden, in a social media post, thanked his supporters for \u201cmessages of concern.\u201d He added: \u201cI hope this serves as a reminder: wear a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands.\u201d\nCleveland officials say they\u2019re aware of 11 positive coronavirus cases related to the setup and planning for Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate.\nThe city said in a statement Friday that it\u2019s working with state and federal officials and is involved with interviewing those who tested positive.\nCleveland officials say most of the cases stemming from the pre-debate planning and setup involved people from out of state. They say health officials are now looking into their travels.\nTrump was last seen by reporters returning to the White House on Thursday evening and did not appear visibly ill. Trump is 74 years old, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from a virus that has infected more than 7 million people nationwide.\nThe president\u2019s physician said in a memo that Trump and the first lady, who is 50, \u201care both well at this time\u201d and \u201cplan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence.\u201d\nThe diagnosis marks a devastating blow for a president who has been trying desperately to convince the American public that the worst of the pandemic is behind them. In the best of cases, if he develops no symptoms, which can include fever, cough and breathing trouble, it will likely force him off the campaign trail just weeks before the election and puts his participation in the second presidential debate, scheduled for Oct. 15 in Miami, into doubt.\nTrump\u2019s handling of the pandemic has already been a major flashpoint in his race against Democrat Joe Biden, who spent much of the summer off the campaign trail and at his home in Delaware because of the virus. Biden has since resumed a more active campaign schedule, but with small, socially distanced crowds. He also regularly wears a mask in public, something Trump mocked him for at Tuesday night\u2019s debate.\n\u201cI don\u2019t wear masks like him,\u201d Trump said of Biden. \u201cEvery time you see him, he\u2019s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from me, and he shows up with the biggest mask I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\nTrump and Biden did not shake hands during the debate, but stood without masks about 10 feet apart for the 90-minute event.\nTrump\u2019s doctor says Trump is being treated with an experimental drug aimed at supplying antibodies to help fight his coronavirus infection.\nAntibodies are proteins the body makes when an infection occurs. They attach to a virus and help it be eliminated. But it can take weeks for them to form. The drugs are purified versions of ones that seemed to work best in lab and animal tests.\nTrump is receiving a two-antibody combo drug that\u2019s currently in late-stage studies from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. The company previously developed a successful treatment for Ebola using a similar approach.\nIt\u2019s given as a one-time treatment through an IV.\nTrump\u2019s physician, Dr. Sean Conley, said the drug was being given \u201cas a precautionary measure,\u201d and that Trump also was taking zinc, vitamin D, an antacid called famotidine, melatonin and aspirin. None of those have been proven to be effective against COVID-19.\nTrump apparently is not receiving hydroxychloroquine, a drug he widely promoted that has been shown in many studies to be ineffective for preventing or treating COVID-19.\nAnnounced positive COVID-19 tests Friday"

Gen. Michael Flynn discussed an executive order to seize and examine voting machines across the country.\nTrump invited Powell to consider the possibility that she be appointed a special counsel and be given high-level security clearances to investigate the 2020 election. The meeting was highly contentious, sources told ABC News, filled with screaming and demands from Powell, who called other Trump aides \u201dquitters\u201d for giving up the fight.\nThe meeting ended with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and other Trump attorneys talking the president out of making the offer, the sources said. Giuliani, who joined the meeting by phone, also opposed the idea, according to sources.\nPowell did not respond to ABC News' request for comment. She was at the White House Sunday as well, but the reason was unclear.\nBarr's candid comments came when he answered reporters' questions at an unrelated news conference.\nThe attorney general also was asked about the potential that a president could pardon himself, to which he said that he did not want to \u201dopine on constitutional issue.\u201d\nBarr was also asked about the SolarWinds cyber hack of key federal agencies and high-profile private companies, and he said that he agreed with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who attributed the hack to the Russians.\n\u201cIt appears to be the Russians,\u201d Barr said, adding that he can\u2019t comment any further.\nOver the weekend, President Trump contradicted Pompeo, suggesting China could be responsible for the hack. He has not spoken out against Russia.\n\u201dThe Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality. I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control. Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of... discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!),\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\nABC News' John Santucci, Katherine Faulders, Matt Mosk, Olivia Rubin and Alexander Mallin contributed to this report.",

        "context": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr has no plans to appoint special counsels to investigate President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, or to investigate President Donald Trump\u2019s unfounded claims of election fraud, he said on Monday. Speaking to reporters two days before he plans to step down from his position as the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official, Barr once again distanced himself from Trump\u2019s claims, contrary to evidence, that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud. Barr, one of Trump\u2019s staunchest supporters, said he saw \u201cno basis\u201d for the federal government to seize voting machines used in the Nov. 3 presidential election and affirmed earlier comments that he saw no evidence of systemic fraud in the election. \u201cI stand by that statement,\u201d Barr said on Monday, referring to comments made in a Dec. 1 interview with the Associated Press. Barr last week said he would leave office on Dec. 23, a little less than a month before Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. Trump announced Barr\u2019s resignation after criticizing him for not supporting his fraud claims. Barr declined to say if he thought Trump could pre-emptively pardon himself, which would effectively immunize him from federal investigations after leaving office. The U.S. courts have not resolved if a president as a legal right to do this, as no president has yet attempted a self-pardon. State and federal election officials have repeatedly said there is no evidence to support Trump\u2019s claims that his defeat was the result of widespread fraud. Multiple courts have rejected lawsuits brought by Trump supporters advancing those claims. Slideshow ( 5 images ) Biden beat Trump by 306 to 232 votes in the state-by-state Electoral College that chooses the president, as well as by more than 7 million ballots in the popular vote. Hunter Biden disclosed earlier this month the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Delaware is investigating his tax affairs. The Hunter Biden investigation \u201cis being handled responsibly and professionally currently within the department,\u201d Barr told a news conference. Last week, Barr\u2019s successor, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, in a Reuters interview declined to say if he would appoint a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden or election issues, but said he would he would act on any issues \u201con the basis of the law and the facts.\u201d In May 2019, Barr tapped federal prosecutor John Durham to investigate Obama-era intelligence and law enforcement officials for possible crimes in connection with their early-stage probe of whether Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign colluded with the Russian government. On Dec. 1, Barr disclosed he had elevated Durham to the role of special counsel in October so that he could continue his criminal investigation - a move that will make it politically difficult for Biden to remove him from the post until the probe has concluded. Barr said on Monday he expected Durham and his team \u201cwill be able to finish their work.\u201d Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives in December 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden. Trump was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate in February. Trump has privately been mulling whether to pressure the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel to look in to Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the matter, Reuters reported earlier.",
        "summarized_context": "Attorney General William Barr has stated that he sees no reason to appoint a special counsel to investigate possible fraud in the November election or to investigate Joe Biden's son, Hunter. Barr also rejected the idea of the federal government seizing voting machines, as suggested by Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. Barr reiterated his previous statement that there was not enough fraud to affect the election outcome. He also expressed hope that President-elect Joe Biden would allow special counsel John Durham to complete his investigation into the origins of the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation. Barr is set to step down on Wednesday."

The official says Biden made the decision before news surfaced that Trump was being transferred to a military hospital for a \u201cfew days\u201d of treatment.\nAt least so far, Trump\u2019s campaign has not begun removing any of its attack ads against Biden.\nThe presidential election is just over one month away.\n\u2014 AP writer Steve Peoples\n___\n5:55 p.m.\nFormer President Barack Obama is extending his \u201cbest wishes\u201d to President Donald Trump following his coronavirus diagnosis.\nObama said Friday that even during \u201cbig political battles\u201d it\u2019s important to remember that \u201cwe\u2019re all Americans, and we\u2019re all human beings.\u201d\nHe spoke during a virtual fundraiser with Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\nObama says he and his wife, Michelle Obama, hope for a speedy recovery for Trump and the first lady and anyone who has been affected by coronavirus around the country.

He also says he\u2019s received two tests, and both came back negative.\nSpeaking at an event in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Friday, Biden said he received a test in Delaware and one from \u201cthe former White House doctor\u201d who came up to Delaware to administer the test, \u201cand everything\u2019s clear.\u201d\nThe president said early Friday that he and his wife, Melania Trump, had tested positive for coronavirus. Biden was tested after spending nearly 90 minutes onstage with the president during their debate earlier this week.\nBiden said he wished the president and the first lady a full recovery and that \u201cthis is not a matter of politics.\u201d Biden said it was a \u201creminder to all of us that we have to take this virus seriously. It is not going away automatically.\u201d\n___\n4:40 p.m.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s doctor says Trump is being treated with an experimental drug aimed at supplying antibodies to help fight his coronavirus infection.\nAntibodies are proteins the body makes when an infection occurs. They attach to a virus and help it be eliminated. But it can take weeks for them to form. The drugs are purified versions of ones that seemed to work best in lab and animal tests.\nTrump is receiving a two-antibody combo drug that\u2019s currently in late-stage studies from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. The company previously developed a successful treatment for Ebola using a similar approach.\nIt\u2019s given as a one-time treatment through an IV.\nTrump\u2019s physician, Dr. Sean Conley, said the drug was being given \u201cas a precautionary measure,\u201d and that Trump also was taking zinc, vitamin D, an antacid called famotidine, melatonin and aspirin. None of those have been proven to be effective against COVID-19.\nTrump apparently is not receiving hydroxychloroquine, a drug he widely promoted that has been shown in many studies to be ineffective for preventing or treating COVID-19.\n___\n4 p.m.\nSupreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett and her husband had coronavirus earlier this year and recovered, according to two administration officials.\nThe officials were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\nBarrett was nominated to the high court last week after the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Trump held a press conference outside where few people wore masks.\nTrump announced Friday that he and first lady Melania Trump had tested positive for the virus, after aide Hope Hicks was diagnosed.\nBarrett has also been meeting with senators ahead of her confirmation hearing, including Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who also announced Friday that he had tested positive for the virus.\nThe science is unclear on whether someone who has the virus can get it again. Whether someone who\u2019s been infected with coronavirus has protection against future infection and for how long is unknown.

The official says Biden made the decision before news surfaced that Trump was being transferred to a military hospital for a \u201cfew days\u201d of treatment. At least so far, Trump\u2019s campaign has not begun removing any of its attack ads against Biden. The presidential election is just over one month away. \u2014 AP writer Steve Peoples ___ 5:55 p.m. Former President Barack Obama is extending his \u201cbest wishes\u201d to President Donald Trump following his coronavirus diagnosis. Obama said Friday that even during \u201cbig political battles\u201d it\u2019s important to remember that \u201cwe\u2019re all Americans, and we\u2019re all human beings.\u201d He spoke during a virtual fundraiser with Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Obama says he and his wife, Michelle Obama, hope for a speedy recovery for Trump and the first lady and anyone who has been affected by coronavirus around the country. Harris says she and her husband, Doug Emhoff, share their \u201cdeepest prayers\u201d for the Trumps. \u201cLet it be a reminder to all of us that we must remain vigilant and take care of ourselves and take care of each other,\u201d she said. Their comments came amid news that Trump will be taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for a \u201cfew days\u201d on the advice of his doctors. ___ 5:15 p.m. The White House says President Donald Trump will spend a \u201cfew days\u201d at a military hospital on the advice of his physicians after contracting COVID-19. Trump is to depart the White House by helicopter early Friday evening for Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. The White House says that the visit is precautionary and that Trump will work from the hospital\u2019s presidential suite, which is equipped to allow him to continue his official duties. Earlier Friday the White House said Trump remains \u201cfatigued\u201d and had been injected with an experimental antibody drug combination for the virus that has killed more than 205,000 Americans and spread to the highest reaches of the U.S. government. ___ 4:50 p.m. Democrat Joe Biden says President Donald Trump testing positive for the coronavirus is a \u201cbracing reminder\u201d of the seriousness of the virus. He also says he\u2019s received two tests, and both came back negative. Speaking at an event in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Friday, Biden said he received a test in Delaware and one from \u201cthe former White House doctor\u201d who came up to Delaware to administer the test, \u201cand everything\u2019s clear.\u201d The president said early Friday that he and his wife, Melania Trump, had tested positive for coronavirus. Biden was tested after spending nearly 90 minutes onstage with the president during their debate earlier this week. Biden said he wished the president and the first lady a full recovery and that \u201cthis is not a matter of politics.\u201d Biden said it was a \u201creminder to all of us that we have to take this virus seriously. It is not going away automatically.\u201d ___ 4:40 p.m. President Donald Trump\u2019s doctor says Trump is being treated with an experimental drug aimed at supplying antibodies to help fight his coronavirus infection. Antibodies are proteins the body makes when an infection occurs. They attach to a virus and help it be eliminated. But it can take weeks for them to form. The drugs are purified versions of ones that seemed to work best in lab and animal tests. Trump is receiving a two-antibody combo drug that\u2019s currently in late-stage studies from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. The company previously developed a successful treatment for Ebola using a similar approach. It\u2019s given as a one-time treatment through an IV. Trump\u2019s physician, Dr. Sean Conley, said the drug was being given \u201cas a precautionary measure,\u201d and that Trump also was taking zinc, vitamin D, an antacid called famotidine, melatonin and aspirin. None of those have been proven to be effective against COVID-19. Trump apparently is not receiving hydroxychloroquine, a drug he widely promoted that has been shown in many studies to be ineffective for preventing or treating COVID-19. ___ 4 p.m. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett and her husband had coronavirus earlier this year and recovered, according to two administration officials. The officials were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Barrett was nominated to the high court last week after the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Trump held a press conference outside where few people wore masks. Trump announced Friday that he and first lady Melania Trump had tested positive for the virus, after aide Hope Hicks was diagnosed. Barrett has also been meeting with senators ahead of her confirmation hearing, including Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who also announced Friday that he had tested positive for the virus. The science is unclear on whether someone who has the virus can get it again. Whether someone who\u2019s been infected with coronavirus has protection against future infection and for how long is unknown. A large study from Iceland last month suggested that antibodies that people make to fight the virus last for at least four months. However, several cases have been confirmed of people getting COVID-19 again, months after their initial bout. \u2014 By AP writers Colleen Long and Jonathan Lemire ___ 3:30 p.m. Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, a frequent target of President Donald Trump\u2019s, is blasting him for what she calls \u201cactively spreading a deadly virus.\u201d Omar said earlier this year that her father died of the virus, and she said in a statement Friday that she doesn\u2019t wish it on anyone. Omar, a Democrat, says the nation has been waiting for months to hear Trump say America \u201cwill get through this together.\u201d And she says he\u2019s saying that now because it\u2019s about him. Trump announced earlier Friday that he and the first lady had tested positive for the coronavirus. She criticized Trump for holding a rally and fundraiser this week in Minnesota without wearing a mask, saying he exposed hundreds of people in a state where cases are already rising. ___ 2:40 p.m. The White House does not appear to be making any changes to current virus protocol, even after President Donald Trump and the first lady tested positive for COVID-19. A senior White House official said Friday that masks will still not be mandatory at the White House, describing facial coverings as \u201ca personal choice,\u201d despite overwhelming evidence that they help to stop the spread. And the White House is not planning to move to a different, more reliable testing system after the one it uses failed to detect that adviser Hope Hicks had the virus the day she began experiencing symptoms. The president, his White House and his campaign have generally taken a lax approach to the pandemic, continuing to hold large events and failing to abide by social distancing recommendations. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal White House thinking, defended the current system. \u2014 AP writer Jill Colvin ___ 2:30 p.m. The vice presidential debate between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris next week will go on as scheduled after President Donald Trump tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday. An official with the Commission on Presidential Debates confirmed that no changes are anticipated to the Wednesday night debate in Salt Lake City. Both Pence and Harris underwent tests for the coronavirus on Friday and tested negative. Pence\u2019s physician said in a memo that the vice president was not considered a \u201cclose contact\u201d of anyone infected with COVID-19 and was not required to quarantine. \u201cVice President Mike Pence remains in good health and is free to go about his normal activities,\u201d said Navy Lt. Commander Dr. Jesse Schonau in a statement. ___ 2 p.m. President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager says all campaign events involving the president and his family will either be turned into virtual events or postponed until further notice. Bill Stepien, who heads Trump\u2019s reelection, says Vice President Mike Pence, who has tested negative for COVID-19, plans to continue to his campaign schedule. The announcement comes after Trump tweeted earlier Friday that he and his wife tested positive for the coronavirus. It is not clear when the president was exposed. One of the president\u2019s top advisers, Hope Hicks, tested positive on Thursday for the virus. Two others \u2014 Utah Sen. Mike Lee and University of Notre Dame president Rev. John Jenkins \u2014 who attended Trump\u2019s Rose Garden ceremony on Saturday to announce the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 have also tested positive for the virus. ___ 1:55 p.m. Comedian Joe Piscopo attended the fundraiser at Bedminster on Thursday, which he described as a small gathering in New Jersey for Trump\u2019s friends. \u201cIt was meticulously run, from the Secret Service to COVID testing to masking,\u201d Piscopo told The Associated Press on the phone. The president came out of the portico to talk to guests seated at tables \u201cyards and yards\u201d away. Piscopo said he was at the back of the crowd and said, \u201cWe were all social distancing and it was all outside.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him more on top of his game, warm, funny, vulnerable.\u201d The president gave a 30-minute speech. Piscopo said he could not talk about it specifically but said that it was \u201call positive.\u201d The president then answered questions. Piscopo said the president greeted the crowd of friends and called out to him specifically. ___ 1:30 p.m. Minnesota health officials are urging people who attended events associated with President Donald Trump\u2019s visit this week to consider being tested for the coronavirus. The Minnesota Department of Health on Friday urged anyone with symptoms to be tested right away. Trump announced early Friday morning that he had been diagnosed with COVID-19, just two days after he held a campaign rally in Duluth and a fundraiser in a Minneapolis suburb. The health department said community transmission was high in St. Louis County -- which includes Duluth -- before the rally, and attendees may have been infectious without realizing it. ___ 1:25 p.m. University of Notre Dame\u2019s president has confirmed he has tested positive for the coronavirus days after attending President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he was nominating Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Rev. John Jenkins was invited to the Rose Garden ceremony because Barrett is a Notre Dame University alumna and law school professor. He apologized earlier this week for not wearing a mask at the ceremony. In a message sent to Notre Dame community Friday, Jenkins said that he had learned that a colleague he was in contact with had tested positive for the virus, and he went into self-quarantine. Jenkins said he too was tested and learned he had the virus. Trump announced earlier Friday that he and the first lady have tested positive for the virus. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who attended the ceremony, also announced on Friday that he has tested positive for coronavirus. ___ 1:10 p.m. The Pennsylvania Department of Health is encouraging people who were at President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign rally at Harrisburg International Airport on Saturday to get tested if they are feeling sick. The department is asking people to download the COVID Alert PA phone app if they do test positive to anonymously alert people they may have come in contact with. Thousands attended the outdoor rally, held hours after the president introduced his Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, from the Rose Garden at the White House. Those at the rally were required to pass through a security checkpoint and get their temperatures taken. Trump announced earlier Friday that he and the first lady have tested positive for the coronavirus. ___ 12:45 p.m. Joe Biden is moving forward with plans to travel to Michigan on Friday after he and his wife, Jill, tested negative for the coronavirus. The Democratic presidential nominee had planned on traveling to Grand Rapids, Michigan, to talk about the economy on Friday morning. His trip was delayed by several hours as he awaited the test results. He was tested for the virus after attending Tuesday\u2019s debate with President Donald Trump. The president said early Friday that he and his wife, Melania Trump, tested positive for coronavirus. Biden spent much of the spring and early summer close to his Wilmington, Delaware, home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. But he\u2019s stepped up his travel in the final stretch of the campaign, while still taking heed of public health guidelines. He regularly wears a mask in public, something that Trump taunted Biden for during this week\u2019s debate. And he mostly appears in front of small, socially distanced crowds. ___ 12:30 p.m. Joe Biden has tested negative for the coronavirus, his primary care doctor confirmed on Friday. The Democratic presidential nominee and his wife were tested earlier in the day after news of President Donald Trump\u2019s infection was announced. Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor released the negative results in a statement issued by the Biden campaign. Biden was on the debate stage with Trump for more than 90 minutes earlier in the week. It\u2019s still unclear if Biden will hold campaign events later in the day. Biden, in a social media post, thanked his supporters for \u201cmessages of concern.\u201d He added: \u201cI hope this serves as a reminder: wear a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands.\u201d ___ 12:15 p.m. Utah Sen. Mike Lee says he has tested positive for the coronavirus after experiencing \u201csymptoms consistent with longtime allergies.\u201d Lee visited the White House on Saturday for President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he had nominated Judge Amy Comey Barrett to the Supreme Court. Lee\u2019s disclosure comes after Trump said in an early-morning tweet that he and first lady Melania Trump had tested positive for the virus. Lee said in his statement that he had tested negative for the virus when he visited the White House for Saturday\u2019s event, which featured little social distancing and few masks. The Utah Republican also met with Barrett on Tuesday in the Capitol. The two sat in chairs that were distanced several feet apart but took a photo before the meeting in which they were closer together. He also spoke to reporters after the meeting, removing his mask in front of the cameras as most lawmakers generally do. ___ 11:55 a.m. First lady Melania Trump says she is experiencing \u201cmild symptoms\u201d after she and President Donald Trump tested positive for COVID-19. \u201cThank you for the love you are sending our way. I have mild symptoms but overall feeling good. I am looking forward to a speedy recovery,\u201d she tweeted Friday morning. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said President Trump was also experiencing mild symptoms, but continues to work from the White House residence as he quarantines. The Trumps\u2019 youngest child, Barron, 14, has tested negative for the virus.",
        "summarized_context": "President Donald Trump's campaign manager, Bill Stepien, has tested positive for COVID-19, joining a growing list of individuals in Trump's circle who have contracted the virus. Stepien received his diagnosis on Friday and is experiencing mild symptoms. Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, also announced that she had tested positive. Meanwhile, the White House physician has initiated Remdesivir therapy for President Trump, who is said to be doing well and not requiring supplemental oxygen. Trump's former adviser Kellyanne Conway and Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina have also tested positive for the virus."

            "LISTEN TO ARTICLE 1:48 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email\nA federal appeals court granted President Donald Trump an order delaying enforcement of the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s subpoena for his tax returns while it considers his latest legal challenge but may rule quickly in the matter.\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York on Tuesday granted Trump\u2019s request for a stay, setting arguments in the case for Sept. 25. The sped-up appeals process means a decision in the case may come before the presidential election in November, though grand jury secrecy laws will likely prevent the information from becoming public before then, even if Trump loses.\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have said they will seek review from the U.S. Supreme Court if they lose in the Manhattan-based Second Circuit.\n\u201cWe are pleased that the Second Circuit granted the stay of the enforcement of the subpoena. We look forward to arguing the merits on Appeal\u201d Jay Sekulow, the president\u2019s lawyer said in a statement.\nU.S. District Judge Victor Marrero last month rejected Trump\u2019s claims that the subpoena, to his accountants at Mazars USA, was issued in bad faith and is overbroad. Vance is seeking eight years of the president\u2019s taxes and other financial records as part of a grand jury investigation that includes payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.\nThe Supreme Court in July rejected Trump\u2019s argument that he\u2019s immune to state criminal investigations. In a hearing Tuesday morning, a lawyer for Vance asked the court to allow Vance to enforce the subpoena without delay.\nThe appeals court is separately considering how to move forward on Trump\u2019s attempt to block subpoenas by two Congressional committees seeking his financial records from Deutsche Bank AG. The U.S. Supreme Court in July sent that case back to the New York-based appeals court, all but guaranteeing it won\u2019t be resolved until after the election.\nThe case is Trump v. Vance, 20-02766, Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (Manhattan).\n\u2014 With assistance by Jordan Fabian\n( Updates with court granting Trump\u2019s request for a stay )",
            "An appeals court temporarily blocked a Manhattan prosecutor\u2019s subpoena seeking access to President Trump\u2019s financial records, including his tax returns, setting up a court hearing battle for the end of September.\nA panel of judges from the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled on Tuesday in favor of the Trump legal team's quickly filed emergency appeal for a stay as the appeals court prepares to take up the case. This comes after Judge Victor Marrero rejected Trump\u2019s district court challenge to New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance\u2019s subpoena last month following his defeat in the Supreme Court.\nThe appeals court\u2019s clerk of the court said that \u201cit is hereby ordered that a stay of the district court\u2019s order and judgment pending determination of the appeal is granted.\u201d The merits argument of the appeal will be held on Sept. 25, with Trump\u2019s appeal brief due on Sept. 11, Vance\u2019s brief due by Sept. 21, and Trump\u2019s response due by Sept. 24. All this makes it increasingly unlikely that Vance will gain access to Trump's financial records before the November election.\nThe New York prosecutor is seeking the documents as part of an investigation into potential state crimes relating to hush-money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election. The president's legal team has argued that the Constitution's supremacy clause prevents investigations into a sitting president, a notion with which lower courts have disagreed.\nVance\u2019s lawyers had told the appeals court that delay in the enforcement of its subpoena had already \u201cimposed real costs on the Office \u2014 for nearly an entire year, the grand jury\u2019s investigation has been substantially hampered.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s team argued that Trump\u2019s legal argument \u201cno longer contains difficult questions of constitutional law\u201d and \u201cis no more than a run-of-the-mill attack.\u201d Vance\u2019s team said that \u201ccontinued delay of the grand jury\u2019s investigation is unwarranted, and it would significantly impair the Office\u2019s ability to discharge its constitutionally protected duty to investigate and, where appropriate, prosecute violations of New York law.\u201d He claimed that \u201cdelay can lead to the loss of evidence, fading memories, and the running of statutes of limitation.\u201d\nIn countering those arguments, Trump\u2019s lawyers said that \u201cthe Court cannot provide any relief if the District Attorney discloses the records while this appeal is ongoing\u201d and that New York law \u201cdoesn\u2019t strictly forbid the disclosure of records produced to the grand jury.\u201d Trump\u2019s team said that \u201cthis could include disclosure as part of an indictment or a grand-jury report as well as to third parties\u201d and that \u201cfor the District Attorney\u2019s argument to even get out of the starting gate, then, he would need to commit to keep these records confidential during the appeal\u201d but that \u201che has made no such commitment.\u201d The president\u2019s lawyers said that \u201cthere is no doubt that the President will suffer irreparable harm\u201d and claimed that \u201cit is disclosure of these records to the government \u2014 not just to the public \u2014 that causes injury.\u201d\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office issued a court filing in August that appeared to show that it is investigating potential bank and insurance fraud in the Trump Organization.\nProsecutors did not explicitly identify the focus of their investigation but claimed that \u201dundisputed\u201d news reports about the organization's business conduct provide a legitimate basis for their subpoena seeking the president's financial records. Those reports said that Trump inflated his net worth and the values of his properties to lenders and insurers. The president's legal team asserts that he did nothing wrong.\n\u201cThe concept of temporary absolute immunity would bear adverse consequences for the fair and effective administration of justice. Theoretically, if reelected, a President could be in office for eight years, perhaps longer in the case of a President who assumes office to fill a vacancy in the presidency. For a prosecutor to wait until then to obtain vital records necessary for an investigation of potential criminal conduct would risk that key witnesses would no longer be available and that their memories of the events would have significantly dimmed,\u201d Marrero said last month.\nThe Supreme Court ruled in a 7-2 July decision that \u201cArticle II and the Supremacy Clause do not categorically preclude, or require a heightened standard for, the issuance of a state criminal subpoena\u201d to a sitting president.\n\u201cTwo hundred years ago, a great jurist of our Court established that no citizen, not even the president, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. \u201dWe reaffirm that principle today and hold that the president is neither absolutely immune from state criminal subpoenas seeking his private papers nor entitled to a heightened standard of need.\u201d\n\u201dThis is all a political prosecution,\u201d Trump tweeted after that ruling. \u201dI won the Mueller Witch Hunt, and others, and now I have to keep fighting in a politically corrupt New York. Not fair to this Presidency or Administration!\u201d"

        "context": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday urged a federal appeals court not to let Manhattan\u2019s top prosecutor have his tax returns, saying \u201cthe deck was clearly stacked against\u201d him, and said he would ask the Supreme Court to intervene if necessary. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump arrives at Chennault International Airport to visit nearby areas damaged by Hurricane Laura in Lake Charles, Louisiana, U.S., August 29, 2020. REUTERS/Tom Brenner The argument was made in a filing with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, which on Tuesday will hear arguments on Trump\u2019s bid to delay Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance\u2019s subpoena for the tax returns during Trump\u2019s appeal. Absent a delay, Trump requested a stay to give the Supreme Court time to consider his request. A spokesman for Vance declined to comment. The district attorney is seeking eight years of tax returns from Trump\u2019s longtime accounting firm Mazars USA in connection with a criminal probe of the president\u2019s business practices. Trump has fought the subpoena for a year. He suffered a defeat in July when the Supreme Court rejected his claim of immunity from criminal probes while in the White House. The tax returns are unlikely to become public before the Nov. 3 presidential election. Vance has said the continued litigation has effectively given Trump the \u201ctemporary absolute immunity\u201d that courts have rejected. On Aug. 20, U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero refused for a second time to block the subpoena, saying \u201cjustice requires an end to this controversy.\u201d But Monday\u2019s filing said Trump was not resurrecting his broad immunity claim, arguing instead that the subpoena was overbroad and issued in bad faith, and that Vance should have to show why its contents were relevant to his probe. \u201cThe District Attorney should not have been allowed to \u2018run roughshod\u2019 over the President in his pursuit of claims that the Supreme Court held he could raise,\u201d the filing said. The filing said enforcing the subpoena would cause Trump irreparable harm. \u201cIt is disclosure of these records to the government\u2014not just to the public\u2014that causes injury,\u201d it said.",
        "summarized_context": "A federal appeals court has granted President Donald Trump's request to delay the enforcement of a subpoena for his tax returns while it considers his legal challenge. The court has set arguments in the case for September 25, and a decision may come before the November presidential election. However, grand jury secrecy laws will likely prevent the information from becoming public before then. The subpoena, issued by the Manhattan district attorney, seeks eight years of Trump's taxes and other financial records as part of a grand jury investigation. Trump's lawyers have said they will seek review from the US Supreme Court if they lose in the appeals court."

            "\u00a9 Provided by Daily Mail MailOnline logo\nPresident Donald Trump is taking steps to revoke federal funds from New York City and other cities he says are descending into 'anarchy'.\n'My Administration will do everything in its power to prevent weak mayors and lawless cities from taking Federal dollars while they let anarchists harm people, burn buildings, and ruin lives and businesses. We're putting them on notice today,' Trump said in a tweet on Wednesday.\nTrump on Wednesday signed a five-page memo ordering all federal agencies to send reports to the White House Office of Management and Budget on federal funds going to four cities that can be redirected, according to the New York Post.\nIn addition to New York, the memo names Seattle, Washington DC and Portland, Oregon, as potential targets for revocation of federal funds.\n'My Administration will not allow Federal tax dollars to fund cities that allow themselves to deteriorate into lawless zones,' Trump says in the memo, according to the Post.\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo responded by calling the move 'an illegal stunt,' saying of Trump: 'He is not a king. He cannot 'defund' NYC.'\n\u00a9 Provided by Daily Mail President Donald Trump is taking steps to revoke federal funds from New York City and other cities he says are descending into 'anarchy'\n\u00a9 Provided by Daily Mail\n'To ensure that Federal funds are neither unduly wasted nor spent in a manner that directly violates our Government's promise to protect life, liberty, and property, it is imperative that the Federal Government review the use of Federal funds by jurisdictions that permit anarchy, violence, and destruction in America's cities,' the memo states.\nFederal agencies must detail 'all Federal funds provided to Seattle, Portland, New York City, Washington, D.C.'\nAll four cities have seen either surging crime over the summer or protests over racial injustice that have spilled into violence and riots.\nSimultaneously, Trump ordered Attorney General Bill Barr to develop a list within 14 days of 'anarchist jurisdictions' that 'permitted violence and the destruction of property to persist and have refused to undertake reasonable measures' to restore order.\nThe order does not name the cities that Barr should investigate, giving the attorney general discretion as to which cities to designate.\n\u00a9 Provided by Daily Mail Demonstrators raise their fists as a fire burns in the streets of Seattle in June after clashes with law enforcement near the Seattle Police Departments East Precinct\nThe memo also instructs White House budget director Russ Vought to issue guidance in 30 days from Wednesday 'to the heads of agencies on restricting eligibility of or otherwise disfavoring, to the maximum extent permitted by law, anarchist jurisdictions in the receipt of Federal grants.'\nThe amount of funding in question could be massive, with federal grants making up $3.7 billion of DC's annual budget, and a whopping $7 billion in New York.\nMany of those funds are devoted to Medicare and social services programs, however it was not immediately clear which types of funds would be affected by the order.\n'Violence has surged' in New York City\nIn the memo, Trump detailed allegations of local mismanagement against each of the cities named, saying that New York was included because violent crime has skyrocketed even as Mayor Bill de Blasio moved to defund the NYPD.\nShootings in New York soared 166 percent last month compared to August 2019, and murder rose 47 percent, according to NYPD statistics released on Wednesday.\n\u00a9 Provided by Daily Mail Shootings in New York City were up 166 percent last month compared to August 2019, according to police crime statistics released Wednesday\n\u00a9 Provided by Daily Mail Protesters with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement march through Manhattan and confront NYPD officers on August 24\nTrump's memo says that 'in New York City, city officials have allowed violence to spike.'\n'In light of this unconscionable rise in violence, I have offered to provide Federal law enforcement assistance, but both Mayor de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo have rejected my offer,' Trump says in the memo.\nNYC crime wave: Shootings up 166% Shootings in New York City were up 166 percent last month compared to August 2019, according to police crime statistics released Wednesday. The Big Apple has seen a troubling spike in crime and violence this year, and new data shows there were 242 shootings recorded last month. In August 2019 there were just 91 shootings recorded. The number of shootings rose in all boroughs except Staten Island. The number of murders is also up citywide, increasing from 36 in August 2019 to 53 last month, marking a 47 percent rise.\n'While violence has surged, arrests have plummeted. In a 28-day period during the months of June and July, [New York City] arrests were down 62 percent from the same period in 2019,' the memo says.\n'Amidst the rising violence, Mayor Bill de Blasio and the New York City Council agreed to cut one billion dollars from the New York Police Department (NYPD) budget, including by cancelling the hiring of 1,163 officers.'\nThe memo also cites NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea's decision in June to disband the plainclothes anti-crime units, which had been responsible for targeting illegal guns and drugs on the streets.\n'Police officials have cited this decision as a factor contributing to the rise in violence,' the memo says.\nCoumo responded to news of Trump's order by holding an emergency press conference on Wednesday evening.\n'As far as this statement he's going to stop funding for New York City - he's not a king. He thinks he's a king but he's not,' Cuomo said.\n'The statutes contain the conditions [for funding] and he can't override the law. I suspect it's more of a political statement that he's making than anything else, but it's also illegal what he's talking about,' Cuomo said.\nThe governor, a Democrat, said that Trump had 'better have an army if he thinks he's going to walk down the street in New York.'\nSeattle allowed lawless CHAZ to fester, memo says\nThe memo targets Seattle largely for allowing the 'CHAZ' protest zone to occupy several city blocks for nearly a month.\nIn early June, Black Lives Matter protesters forced the Seattle Police Department to abandon the city's East Precinct building and commandeered the facility, establishing the 'Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone', or CHAZ, in the surrounding blocks.\n\u00a9 Provided by Daily Mail The comandeered Seattle Police East Precinct is seen within the CHAZ in June\n\u00a9 Provided by Daily Mail Protesters in Seattle's CHAZ remove a man after he attempted to preach a Christian message on the street in June. The memo names the CHAZ as a reason for defunding Seattle\nProtesters manned barricades and barred city workers from entering the zone, but the area descended into lawlessness when three separate shootings occurred on June 20, 21, and 23.\n'On July 1, Seattle declared the protest zone dismantled,' Trump's memo says. 'But such failed leadership continues to harm the people of Seattle as, in recent weeks, rioters have engaged in violence and destruction of property across Seattle, resulting in at least 59 police officers being injured and multiple businesses and vehicles vandalized.'\nPortland is targeted for 'allowing 99 days of violent unrest'\nThe memo targets Portland for federal defunding for allowing weeks of nightly protests, where fires have been set and clashes with police are frequent.\nEarlier this week, protesters who broke windows and set a fire to a business in the upscale apartment building where Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler lives.\nPortland's police chief denounced the incident, labeling the events an escalation in the street violence that Oregon's largest city has endured for months.\nThe demonstration began late Monday and stretched into the predawn hours of Tuesday, targeting Wheeler, who is also police commissioner and has been criticized for heading up a police force that has repeatedly used tear gas against the demonstrators.\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 3 NEXT SLIDE > Protests are seen earlier this week in Portland, which has seen 99 nights of unrest \u00a9 Provided by Daily Mail\nThe fire was set with a bundle of newspapers in a store housed on the ground floor of Wheeler's building. There were no reports of major damage or injuries.\nPortland Police Chief Chuck Lovell said the demonstrators also wound up targeting other people who live in Wheeler's building and have had nothing to do with the protests.\nPreviously, the demonstrators have almost always clashed with police outside symbols of authority - police buildings and courthouses.\n'The families that live inside have done absolutely nothing to provoke a threat to their lives. As I've stated repeatedly, the nightly violence is coming at increased cost,' he said. 'This is impacting the safety of our entire city and urgent action is needed.'\nWashington DC 'allowed rioters and anarchists to engage in violence'\nTrump's memo says that in Washington DC, 'Mayor Muriel Bowser allowed rioters and anarchists to engage in violence and destruction in late May and early June, requiring me to call in the National Guard to maintain law and order in the Nation's Capital.'\nThe memo, which has reportedly been in the works for weeks, does not mention the crowds of activists who aggressively confronted attendees at the Republican National Convention last week as they returned to their hotels.\nRepublican Senator Rand Paul on Friday called on the FBI to investigate a crowd of protesters that swarmed him as he departed the White House after listening to Trump accept his party's nomination for re-election.\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 3 NEXT SLIDE > Washington DC Police clear protesters out of Black Lives Matter Plaza on Saturday. Police attempted to disperse the crowd after a group of protesters had marched in the area \u00a9 Provided by Daily Mail\nPaul told Fox News Channel he believes the group chanting his name and pushing against his impromptu police escort was paid to incite a riot.\nHe did not say who he believes financially backed them or offer any evidence for his contention.\n'I believe there are going to be people who were involved with the attack on us that actually were paid to come here and are not from Washington, D.C., and are sort of paid to be anarchists,' Paul said.\n'The FBI needs to investigate but the only way you can do it is you have to arrest people.'",

            "\u00a9 Getty Images Mark Esper and President Donald Trump\nTensions between President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Mark Esper continue to erupt publicly, most recently when a Twitter kerfuffle spilled into public view over whether Esper and the Defense Department were supporting cuts of more than $2 billion to the military health care budget.\nIt began after a report from Politico said that Pentagon officials working on Esper's cost-cutting review \u201dhave proposed slashing military health care by $2.2 billion, a reduction that some defense officials say could effectively gut the Pentagon's health care system during a nationwide pandemic.\u201d\nThat led the President to tweet Monday night that \u201da proposal by Pentagon officials to slash Military Healthcare by $2.2 billion dollars has been firmly and totally rejected by me. We will do nothing to hurt our great Military professionals & heroes as long as I am your President. Thank you!\u201d\nA short time later, Esper tweeted that \u201das we stated yesterday in response to an inaccurate story, I have not directed nor approved any cuts to our military healthcare system in our future budgets. Furthermore, I will not allow any reductions that would harm access to quality medical care for our service members, their families, and our larger DoD community. Our goal remains to ensure a medically fit fighting force and a highly trained and capable military medical cadre.\u201d\n'Yesper?'\nThe Pentagon press office had already criticized the story, which Politico stands behind.\nThe Pentagon insists Esper has not proposed cuts or even seen a proposal for that action. But the President's tweet reinforced the claims that there is some type of Pentagon proposal in the works.\nIt's just the most recent example of Trump publicly poking at his fourth defense chief in three-and-a-half years. When asked by a reporter on August 15 if he had confidence in Esper, the President answered \u201dMark 'Yesper?' Did you call him 'Yesper'?\u201d\nIt was perhaps an odd dig because the less than flattering moniker has been used by those who believe Esper will always say yes to any of the President's ideas.\n\u201dSome people call him 'Yesper.' No, I get along with him. I get along with him fine. He's fine,\u201d Trump said. When asked pointedly if he is considering firing Esper, Trump said, \u201dI consider firing everybody. At some point -- at some point, that's what happens.\u201d\nAn aide close to Esper says the secretary has no plans to step down and will continue to serve at the \u201dpleasure of the President.\u201d The official insists the secretary is not concerned about unflattering attention from the President.\n\u201dIt's just something that is baked into being a member of the Cabinet,\u201d the official said. \u201dFor Esper it's not an issue.\u201d\nTrump may have few options for a new secretary of defense other than waiting to see if he is reelected. For now, if he were to fire Esper, the deputy defense secretary David Norquist would take over as a placeholder until a new secretary could be confirmed, most likely next year.\nIf he stays on the job, Esper still has months of challenges ahead in dealing with Trump.\nOne recent point of friction has been the push by Pentagon leaders to rename bases now named after Confederate generals -- something Trump has adamantly opposed. Several Defense Department officials privately say they now expect a congressional measure to pass after the election renaming the bases.\nEsper's staff is also still holding onto a key report on the role the military played during June 1 protests in Washington, DC, especially around Lafayette Square where peaceful protestors were cleared so the President could stage a photo op. The report is expected to be made public before the election.\nOne official familiar with some of the initial findings says overall it endorses the idea that National Guard forces are best suited to support law enforcement in protests. Trump had threatened to deploy active duty forces on to American streets, something Esper opposed unless the situation became dire.\nEsper has also come under criticism from some in the White House for saying he hopes to visit China in the coming months, an apparent misstep that means Esper may be required to once again solidify his anti-China credentials with the White House. He is expected to visit the Asian Pacific region where he will speak out about China, as he often has.",

            "\u00a9 Provided by Associated Press FILE - This 2018 portrait released by the U.S. Department of Justice shows Connecticut's U.S. Attorney John Durham. Former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith will plead guilty to making a false statement in the first criminal case arising from U.S. Attorney John Durham's investigation into the probe of ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign. (U.S. Department of Justice via AP)\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A former FBI lawyer pleaded guilty Wednesday to altering a document related to the secret surveillance of a former Trump campaign adviser during the Russia investigation.\nKevin Clinesmith is the first current or former official to be charged in a special Justice Department review of the investigation into ties between Russia and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Attorney General William Barr appointed John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, to scrutinize decisions made by officials during that probe.\nClinesmith pleaded guilty to a single false statement charge, admitting that he doctored an email that the FBI relied on as it sought court approval to eavesdrop on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page in 2017.\nThe sentencing guidelines call for zero to six months in prison, but the punishment is ultimately up to U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who accepted Clinesmith\u2019s plea. Sentencing was scheduled for Dec. 10. Clinesmith resigned from the FBI before an internal disciplinary process was completed.\nThe case highlights broader problems with the FBI\u2019s surveillance applications on Page, an issue that has long animated critics of the Russia investigation.\nCharging documents filed Friday say Clinesmith altered an email he received in June 2017 from another government agency to say that Page was \u201cnot a source\u201d for that agency, then forwarded it along to a colleague. The document does not say which agency, but Page has publicly said that he had worked as a source for the CIA.\nThe FBI relied on Clinesmith's representation in the email when it submitted its fourth and final application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to secretly eavesdrop on Page on suspicions that he was a potential Russian agent.\nInformation about any relationship Page may have had with another government agency would have been important to disclose to the FISA court to the extent it could have helped explain, or reframe in a less suspicious light, Page\u2019s interactions with Russians.\nClinesmith mostly answered routine questions from the judge with brief responses, but he did elaborate at one point to clarify the nature of his conduct and to make clear that he believed the information he had included in the email was factually accurate at the time he altered the message.\n\u201cAt the time, I believed the information I was providing in the email was accurate, but I am agreeing that the information I inserted into the email was not originally there and I inserted that information,\u201d Clinesmith said.\nClinesmith's attorney, Justin Shur, said in a statement last week that Clinesmith regretted his actions and had not intended to mislead the court or his colleagues.\nA Justice Department inspector general report issued last December found significant errors and omissions in the four applications that the FBI submitted to eavesdrop on Page, and said officials failed to update the court after receiving new information that undercut the original premise that Page may have been an agent of a foreign power.\nA Senate intelligence committee report Tuesday that examined links between Trump associates and Russia also identified flaws in the FBI\u2019s surveillance, including its reliance on a dossier of opposition research compiled by a former British spy whose work was funded by Democrats.\nPage was never charged with a crime and has denied any wrongdoing.\nFormer Justice Department officials who have testified before Congress in recent months have said they would not have signed off on the surveillance applications had they known then about the problems that have since come to light.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee who has been leading an investigation into the Russia probe, said after Wednesday's plea that \u201cthe wheels of justice are turning.\u201d\n\u201cIt is imperative we restore trust to a broken system and the only way that is possible is for people to be held accountable for their actions,\u201d Graham added. \u201dMore to come.\u201d\nIt remains unclear what additional charges, if any, Durham might bring. Though Justice Department policy is not to take investigative action aimed at affecting an election, Barr has said that doesn't apply here since Durham's probe is not targeting any current candidates for office, including Democratic nominee Joe Biden, who was vice president in the Obama administration when the investigation began. But he has also said he is mindful of the calendar.\nThe FBI said in a statement that it has been cooperating with Durham\u2019s investigation, including by providing documents and assigning officials to help his team.\n____\nFollow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP",
            "The former FBI lawyer charged in U.S. Attorney John Durham\u2019s investigation of the investigators pleaded guilty Wednesday to a false statements charge for fraudulently altering a CIA email to obtain surveillance against a former Trump campaign associate.\nClinesmith, who worked on the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server as well as on the FBI\u2019s Crossfire Hurricane inquiry and special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team during the Trump-Russia inquiry, admitted that he falsified a document during the bureau\u2019s efforts to renew Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act authority to wiretap Carter Page, who had been a foreign policy adviser to now-President Trump's 2016 campaign.\nJudge James Boasberg, the presiding judge in the criminal case against Clinesmith (and also the presiding judge for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court), accepted the plea during the hearing conducted by phone before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nClinesmith, 38, claimed in early 2017 that Page was \u201dnot a source\u201d for the CIA when the CIA had actually told the bureau on multiple occasions that Page was indeed an operational contact for them. Durham submitted a five-page filing to the federal court on Friday, noting Clinesmith was being charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(3) for \u201cFalse Statements.\u201d\nAnthony Scarpelli, an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and a Durham team member, appeared for the Justice Department. Clinesmith\u2019s lawyer, Justin Shur, was representing him on the call.\nThe judge asked Clinesmith if he agreed everything outlined in Durham\u2019s criminal information court filed Friday against Clinesmith was true, and he replied, \u201cYes, your honor.\u201d\nBoasberg then asked if Clinesmith agreed that \u201cyou intentionally altered an email to add the language \u2018not a source\u2019 related to Individual 1 and that you knew such a statement was not in fact true.\u201d\nA pause ensued as Clinesmith\u2019s lawyers muted the call and conferred with him.\n\u201cAt the time, I believed the information that I was providing in the email was accurate, but I am agreeing that the language that I entered into the email was not originally there and that I inserted that in there,\u201d Clinesmith eventually replied.\nThe judge then asked him how he pleaded to the false statements charge, and Clinemsith said, \u201dGuilty.\u201d Boasberg accepted the plea.\nPrior to that, the judge noted that there was a 10-page plea agreement, which has not been made public yet, and Clinesmith said he was entering into it without any threats or coercion. The judge said the agreement states that the government will not prosecute him for anything else listed in the statement of offense and agrees not to seek to detain him between now and sentencing. The judge noted the maximum penalty for the false statements charge was five years in prison but that the sentencing guideline calls for zero to six months behind bars.\nBoasberg also noted early in the hearing how he is \u201dcurrently the presiding judge for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court,\u201d but that \u201cthis case, however, is a criminal case, it is not a FISC case, and it is a case that was randomly assigned to me.\u201d He said the FISA court could potentially be seen as a \u201cvictim\u201d in the case, but thought he could preside over the case fairly without recusing himself, though he added that if either the prosecution or defense wanted him to recuse, then he would. Neither side did.\nThe judge set Clinesmith\u2019s sentencing for Dec. 10 at 11 a.m. Until then, all parties agreed that Clinesmith would continue to be released on his own recognizance, but that he must surrender his passport, not obtain foreign travel documents, and limit his travel to Washington, D.C., Maryland, Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, and West Virginia.\nIt was first revealed on Friday that Clinesmith was expected to plead guilty.\n\u201cOn or about June 19, 2017, within the District of Columbia, the defendant, Kevin Clinesmith, did willfully and knowingly make and use a false wiring and document, knowing the same to contain a materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statement and entry in a matter before the jurisdiction of the executive branch and judicial branch of the Government of the United States,\u201d Durham told the court on Friday.\n\u201cKevin deeply regrets having altered the email,\u201d Clinesmith's lawyer said Friday. \u201cIt was never his intent to mislead the court or his colleagues as he believed the information he relayed was accurate. But Kevin understands what he did was wrong and accepts responsibility.\u201d\nAndrew Weissmann, the Mueller \u201cpit bull\u201d who has been critical of Durham and U.S. Attorney General William Barr and who misrepresented an element of the special counsel\u2019s congressional testimony during an appearance on MSNBC this week, had fired off multiple Twitter threads seeking to undermine the possible plea deal, but to no avail.\nJudge Rosemary Collyer, then the presiding judge over the FISA court, ordered an FBI review of every FISA filing that Clinesmith had ever touched following the release of DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019s December report on the FBI's Russia investigation. The FISA court criticized the FBI's handling of the Page applications as \u201dantithetical to the heightened duty of candor described above\u201d and demanded corrective action from the bureau.\nClinesmith, an assistant general counsel in the National Security and Cyber Law Branch of the FBI\u2019s Office of General Counsel from July 12, 2015, through Sept. 21, 2019, is not named in Horowitz's report, but it is clear he is the \u201dOffice of General Counsel attorney\u201d who had been acting in response to a question by an FBI agent who was part of the team investigating the Trump campaign.\nA supervisory agent, dubbed \u201dSSA 2\u201d who swore in an affidavit for all three FISA renewals against Page in 2017, told Horowitz's investigators that on the third renewal, he wanted \u201da definitive answer to whether Page had ever been a source for another U.S. government agency before he signed the final renewal application.\u201d While in contact with what was reportedly the CIA's liaison, Clinesmith was reminded that in August 2016, predating the first Page warrant application in October 2016, the other agency informed the FBI that Page \u201ddid, in fact, have a prior relationship with that other agency.\u201d\nAn email from the other government agency's liaison was also sent to Clinesmith in 2017, who then \u201daltered the liaison's email by inserting the words 'not a source' into it, thus making it appear that the liaison had said that Page was 'not a source' for the other agency\u201d and sent it to \u201dSupervisory Special Agent 2,\u201d Horowitz found.\n\u201dRelying upon this altered email, SSA 2 signed the third renewal application that again failed to disclose Page's past relationship with the other agency,\u201d the inspector general wrote.\nHorowitz\u2019s report criticized the Justice Department and the FBI for at least 17 \u201csignificant errors and omissions\u201d related to the FISA warrants against Page and for the bureau's reliance on the Democrat-funded discredited dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele. Declassified footnotes from Horowitz\u2019s report indicate that the bureau became aware that Steele\u2019s dossier may have been compromised by Russian disinformation, and FBI interviews show Steele\u2019s primary subsource undercut the credibility of the dossier.\nIn January, the Justice Department determined that the final two of the four Page FISA warrants \u201cwere not valid.\u201d The FBI told the court it was working to \u201dsequester\u201d all the information from the Page wiretaps, and FBI Director Christopher Wray testified to Congress that he was working to \u201dclaw back\u201d that intelligence. The FBI director also testified that the bureau likely illegally surveilled Page.\nIn a scathing July 2018 inspector general report on the FBI's Clinton emails investigation, Clinesmith was mentioned (again not by name) numerous times as being one of the FBI officials who conveyed a possible bias against Trump.\nIn a lengthy instant message exchange between Clinesmith and another FBI employee on Nov. 9, 2016, the day after Trump\u2019s presidential victory, he lamented: \u201cMy god damned name is all over the legal documents investigating his staff,\u201d Clinesmith said, adding, \u201cSo, who knows if that breaks to him what he is going to do?\u201d\nOther messages showed Clinesmith, listed in Horowitz's report as \u201dFBI Attorney 2,\u201d expressed favor toward Clinton and said \u201cViva le resistance\u201d in the weeks after Trump's win."

FILE PHOTO: The Federal Bureau of Investigation seal is seen at FBI headquarters in Washington, U.S. June 14, 2018.

Trump\u2019s Republican allies have repeatedly pointed to that report as evidence of a wider conspiracy by \u201cdeep state\u201d government actors to undermine Trump. There was no indication of a broad conspiracy in the charging documents filed against Clinesmith. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg set a sentencing date for Dec. 10.

            "\u00a9 Provided by Washington Examiner\nA federal judge granted a long list of motions on Monday from outside groups asking to weigh in on the Justice Department\u2019s motion to drop the case against retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn.\nThe schedule indicates the judge, Emmet Sullivan, will stall on dismissing the case even after President Trump granted his former national security adviser a full pardon late last month. Appearing to ignore the Justice Department\u2019s request for the case \u201cimmediately\u201d to be dismissed, the judge, who has been involved in the Flynn case since December 2017, instead moved forward with further debate, with the district court docket showing more than a dozen groups had now been given the green light on amicus briefs they asked permission to file weeks ago.\n\u201cThe President granted General Flynn \u2018a full and unconditional pardon\u2019 for (1) the charge of making false statements to Federal investigators \u2026 (2) any and all possible offenses arising from the facts set forth in the Information and Statement of Offense \u2026 (3) any and all possible offenses within the investigatory authority or jurisdiction of the Special Counsel \u2026 and (4) any and all possible offenses arising out of facts and circumstances ... related to the investigation of the Special Counsel,\u201d the Justice Department told the court at the end of November, adding that \u201cno further proceedings are necessary or appropriate, as the Court must immediately dismiss the case with prejudice.\u201d\nTrump announced the Flynn pardon the day before Thanksgiving, tweeting, \u201cIt is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon.\u201d\nFlynn, 61, fought to dismiss the government's case against him this year after he pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to investigators about his intercepted December 2016 conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\nSullivan's granting of the friend-of-the-court filings instead of just dismissing the case suggests he may drag the proceedings out until President-elect Joe Biden takes office and beyond.\nOn Friday, fellow U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton, who is handling a Freedom of Information Act case related to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, opined that Sullivan might choose to scrutinize Flynn\u2019s pardon. Walton said he didn\u2019t believe Sullivan \u201chas a lot of options in reference to what he does ... unless he takes the position that the wording of the pardon is too broad,\u201d according to the National Law Journal, adding, \u201dtheoretically, the decision could be reached because the wording in the pardon seems to be very, very broad.

            "But Sullivan said whether or not investigators thought Flynn was lying is irrelevant, and prosecutors have not shown evidence that contradicts the substance of the FBI's interview with Flynn.",
            "Federal prosecutors justified their decision by arguing that the FBI's January 2017 interview with Flynn was \u201cuntethered to, and unjustified by\u201c its counterintelligence investigation, and further claimed that the FBI offered \u201cfrail and shifting justifications\u201c for its investigation into Flynn.",

            "Sullivan emphasized Tuesday that courts are not a \u201crubber stamp\u201c.",
            "Similarly, the judge called the government\u2019s \u201cnewly-minted\u201c definition of \u201cmateriality\u201c perplexing, \u201cnot the law\u201c and an unexplained \u201cabout-face\u201c from prior prosecutors\u2019 position that Flynn\u2019s lie\u2019s were \u201cabsolutely material\u201c and \u201cwent to the heart\u201c of the FBI\u2019s investigation.",

            "U.S. District Judge Jeremy Kernodle on Friday night tossed out a lawsuit filed against Vice President Mike Pence by Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) and other Republicans that sought to broaden the vice president's authority to reject electoral votes cast for President-elect Joe Biden on Jan. 6 when he oversees the Electoral College certification. Pence's role is considered ceremonial, and he has the responsibility of opening, announcing, and tallying the results, but the plaintiffs are hoping he takes on an expanded role to invalidate them as part of a longshot, last-ditch effort to overturn the presidential election. Kernodle, who was appointed by President Trump, dismissed the case because he found that Gohmert and his fellow plaintiffs lacked a sufficient legal stake to justify the lawsuit. Kernodle's ruling comes a day after a Justice Department attorney representing Pence requested the lawsuit be rejected. Gohmert has said his lawyers will appeal.\nScroll for 5 things you\nneed to know now\n\u2193",
            "Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert's lawsuit against Vice President Mike Pence, which was designed to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory, has been dismissed.\nFederal judge Jeremy Kernodle ruled on Friday that Gohmert, who was joined by a group of Arizona Republicans who would have been electors for President Trump, don't \u201dhave standing,\u201d a critical element determining jurisdiction.\nThe ruling is a victory for Pence, who through Justice Department lawyers argued in a filing with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas on Thursday that Gohmert and his allies should have sued Congress, not the vice president.\n\u201dPlaintiff Louie Gohmert, the United States Representative for Texas\u2019s First Congressional District, alleges at most an institutional injury to the House of Representatives. Under well-settled Supreme Court authority, that is insufficient to support standing,\u201d Kernodle wrote. \u201dThe other Plaintiffs, the slate of Republican Presidential Electors for the State of Arizona (the 'Nominee-Electors'), allege an injury that is not fairly traceable to the Defendant, the Vice President of the United States, and is unlikely to be redressed by the requested relief.\u201d\n\u201dAccordingly ... the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case and must dismiss the action,\u201d he added.\nKernodle made his ruling without prejudice, meaning Gohmert and the Arizona Republicans could file suit again.\nInstead, in a late-night interview on Newsmax, the Republican congressman announced that his legal team was \u201dpreparing\u201d to appeal the judge's decision to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Around the time a notice was filed, Gohmert said it was his \u201dhope and prayer\u201d that appeal would be taken up before Wednesday when Pence will preside over the joint session of Congress meant to certify the winner of the presidential contest.\nGohmert's lawsuit, filed on Sunday, aimed to provide Pence with \u201cexclusive authority\u201d to determine which Electoral College votes are certifiable, arguing that the vice president has the \u201dsole discretion\u201d to determine the legitimacy of votes via the 12th Amendment. The crux of their case was that parts of the Electoral Count Act, which establishes the procedures for Congress counting the Electoral College votes, are unconstitutional. The lawsuit also claimed there was election fraud.\nThe 14-page response, signed by Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Coghlan, argues that if Gohmert was to file a lawsuit against anybody, it should be Congress.\n\u201dTo the extent any of these particular plaintiffs have a judicially cognizable claim, it would be against the Senate and the House of Representatives,\u201d the DOJ filing said. \u201dAfter all, it is the role prescribed for the Senate and the House of Representatives in the Electoral Count Act to which plaintiffs object, not any actions that Vice President Pence has taken.\u201d\nHouse General Counsel Doug Letter filed an amicus brief in court on Thursday that asked the judge to dismiss the case, dubbing it a \u201dradical departure from our constitutional procedures and consistent legislative practices.\u201d Alan Kennedy, a Colorado elector for Biden, also moved to intervene in the case that he called an \u201dElectoral College fantasy\u201d that must be thrown out.\nGohmert's team argued in a follow-up filing on Friday that the Justice Department lawyers were hiding \u201dbehind procedural arguments\u201d that are \u201deasily disposed.\u201d\nKernodle, who was nominated by Trump in January 2018 and confirmed by the Senate in October 2018, said he could not address the challenge against the constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act of 1887 without ensuring that it has jurisdiction.\n\u201dOne crucial component of jurisdiction is that the plaintiffs have standing. This requires the plaintiffs to show a personal injury that is fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct and is likely to be redressed by the requested relief \u2026 Requiring plaintiffs to make this showing helps enforce the limited role of federal courts in our constitutional system. The problem for Plaintiffs here is that they lack standing. Plaintiff Louie Gohmert, the United States Representative for Texas\u2019s First Congressional District, alleges at most an institutional injury to the House of Representatives. Under well settled Supreme Court authority, that is insufficient to support standing,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201dThe other Plaintiffs, the slate of Republican Presidential Electors for the State of Arizona, allege an injury that is not fairly traceable to the Defendant, the Vice President of the United States, and is unlikely to be redressed by the requested relief. Accordingly \u2026 the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case and must dismiss the action,\u201d Kernodle said.\nThe judge also took particular aim at Gohmert.\n\u201dCongressman Gohmert\u2019s argument is foreclosed by [Supreme Court decision] Raines v. Byrd, which squarely held that Members of Congress lack standing to bring a claim for an injury suffered 'solely because they are Members of Congress.' ... And that is all Congressman Gohmert is alleging here. He does not identify any injury to himself as an individual, but rather a 'wholly abstract and widely dispersed' institutional injury to the House of Representatives,\u201d Kernodle said.\n\u201dHere, Congressman Gohmert\u2019s alleged injury requires a series of hypothetical \u2014 but by no means certain \u2014 events. Plaintiffs presuppose what the Vice President will do on January 6, which electoral votes the Vice President will count or reject from contested states, whether a Representative and a Senator will object under Section 15 of the Electoral Count Act, how each member of the House and Senate will vote on any such objections, and how each state delegation in the House would potentially vote under the Twelfth Amendment absent a majority electoral vote,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201dAll that makes Congressman Gohmert\u2019s alleged injury far too uncertain to support standing under Article III.\u201d\nThe litigation was one vestige of a long-shot effort to stop Congress from certifying Biden's Electoral College victory on Wednesday. A group of House Republicans, joined by Sen. Josh Hawley, plan to object to the results from some states where they claim there was fraud and failure to follow state election laws.\nFederal and state officials have defended the integrity of the election and stress there is no evidence of widespread fraud. Still, Trump refuses to concede the contest nearly two months after Election Day. The inauguration is set for Jan. 20.\nTrump flew back to the White House from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Thursday, earlier than expected, with his focus set on challenging and overturning the election certification process in Congress on Wednesday.\nMike Brest contributed to this report."

        "context": "\u201dWe need say no more, and we affirm the judgment essentially for the reasons stated by the district court,\u201d the appeals court panel wrote. \u201dWe express no view on the underlying merits or on what putative party, if any, might have standing.\u201d The judges who rejected Gohmert's appeal were all Republican appointees. The panel included Reagan appointees Patrick Higginbottom and Jerry Smith, as well as Trump appointee Andrew Oldham. Gohmert\u2019s next stop, if he attempts it, is likely the Supreme Court, which has been reticent to wade into Trump\u2019s flailing legal gambits to salvage his presidency despite losing the election. He could also attempt to take the fight to the full bench of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. While many federal court appeals take months or even years to litigate, the 5th Circuit disposed of this one in less than a day without even taking legal briefs from the parties. Saturday night\u2019s decision follows one from a lower-court judge on Friday. That judge, U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy Kernodle, a Trump appointee based in Tyler, Texas, said Gohmert\u2019s suit, which was filed against Pence, couldn\u2019t be brought by an individual member of Congress, since it alleged an injury that would apply to the entire House and Senate. Gohmert had asked the court to declare that Pence, who is constitutionally required to preside over the Jan. 6 session of Congress to certify the results of the 2020 election, had the sole authority to decide whether some of Biden\u2019s electoral votes should be rejected \u2014 and whether alternative slates of Trump votes could be introduced instead. But Kernodle said Gohmert\u2019s argument relied on entirely speculative circumstances. \u201cCongressman Gohmert\u2019s alleged injury requires a series of hypothetical\u2014but by no means certain\u2014events,\u201d the judge wrote in his 13-page ruling issued Friday evening. \u201cPlaintiffs presuppose what the Vice President will do on January 6, which electoral votes the Vice President will count or reject from contested states, whether a Representative and a Senator will object under Section 15 of the Electoral Count Act, how each member of the House and Senate will vote on any such objections, and how each state delegation in the House would potentially vote under the Twelfth Amendment absent a majority electoral vote.\u201d \u201cAll that makes Congressman Gohmert\u2019s alleged injury far too uncertain to support standing under\u201d the Constitution, Kernodle added. Kernodle\u2019s decision did not completely slam the door on the possibility that Gohmert or the would-be electors might be able to get some relief in court. The judge dismissed the case without prejudice, meaning that Gohmert\u2019s lawyers could try to reframe the suit so it will pass legal muster. Gohmert, who filed the suit on Dec. 27, had asked for a final ruling from Kernodle by Jan. 4 in order to have time for potential appeals. Gohmert and the Arizona plaintiffs notified Kernodle they were appealing to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Friday night, with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upholding the district court's ruling Saturday. Gohmert said in the interview that he still believed in the court system but that the rejection of his suit amounted to leaving those upset about the election with no recourse but street violence. \u201dBottom line is, the court is saying, \u2018we\u2019re not going to touch this, you have no remedy,\u2019\u201d Gohmert said. \u201dBasically, in effect, the ruling would be that you\u2019ve got to go to the streets and be as violent as antifa and BLM.\u201d Kernodle said Gohmert lacked standing under a 1997 Supreme Court ruling that said individual lawmakers did not have standing to challenge a line-item veto law Congress passed a year earlier. The judge\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day ruling said the would-be electors also lacked standing because the harms they were claiming were not really attributable to Pence, but to Gov. Doug Ducey (R-Ariz.), who certified Biden\u2019s electors as the winners in his state. Those electors cast their formal votes on Dec. 14. Although the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution requires Pence, as vice president, to preside over the Jan. 6 session, his specific powers are detailed in the Electoral Count Act of 1887. It requires Pence to introduce electors alphabetically by state, and it sets out a process for House members and senators to challenge disputed electors. Under the Electoral Count Act, that challenge would be resolved by separate votes of the House and Senate \u2014 and in the case of the 2020 election, those challenges would effectively be doomed. The Democratic House majority would certainly oppose them and many Senate Republicans have acknowledged that Biden is the unequivocal winner of the contest. Under Gohmert\u2019s theory, if Pence refused to accept enough electoral votes to put either candidate over the 270-vote threshold, the election would be thrown to the House under a process also laid out in the Twelfth Amendment, which gives state delegations a single vote. That formulation would favor Republicans, who are in the House minority but control more state delegations than Democrats. Pence, represented by Justice Department attorneys, on Thursday urged the court to reject Gohmert\u2019s suit against him, arguing that his fight is with the House and Senate, not the vice president. Pence has not indicated his own view of his power as the presiding officer on Jan. 6, and he hasn\u2019t indicated whether he intends to introduce the unofficial elector slates that Trump allies claim to have cast in order to compete with the certified slates submitted in states like Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia. The House filed its own, more exhaustive brief, dismantling Gohmert\u2019s effort as an unconstitutional and thinly veiled effort to overrule the democratic result of the 2020 election. The framers would never have provided for a process that allowed a sitting vice president \u2014 often, as in this case, an actual candidate on the Electoral College ballot \u2014 to have unilateral authority to choose which electors to count, the House argued.",

The lawsuit sought to expand Pence's authority to reject electoral votes for President-elect Joe Biden during the Electoral College certification on January 6.

            "A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas and 11 Arizona Republicans that sought to force Vice President Mike Pence to essentially overturn the results of the election and hand it to President Donald Trump. U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy Kernodle, a Trump appointee, said Gohmert and his fellow Republicans lacked standing to sue. In what was always seen as a far-fetched effort by Trump allies to change the outcome of the presidential race, Gohmert had argued that Pence could unilaterally alter the Electoral College count. The lawmaker had called on the court to say that Pence, who will preside over the Jan. 6 session to certify the election results, could unilaterally decide whether to throw out some of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s electoral votes.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nKernodle said that Gohmert and his allies couldn\u2019t sue because no individual member of Congress has standing to sue if the harm supposedly affects the entire Congress. But in addition to the standing issue, the judge noted that Gohmert\u2019s claim is entirely speculative and based on a series of hypotheticals. \u201cPlaintiffs presuppose what the Vice President will do on January 6, which electoral votes the Vice President will count or reject from contested states, whether a Representative and a Senator will object under Section 15 of the Electoral Count Act, how each member of the House and Senate will vote on any such objections, and how each state delegation in the House would potentially vote under the Twelfth Amendment absent a majority electoral vote,\u201d Kernodle wrote in his 13-page ruling. \u201cAll that makes Congressman Gohmert\u2019s alleged injury far too uncertain to support standing.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nEven as he dismissed the case, Kernodle still left a door open for Gohmert and his allies to pursue their case in court. By dismissing the case without prejudice, Kernodle gave the lawmaker an opportunity to reframe their lawsuit. After the ruling Friday evening, Gohmert and the other plaintiffs said they would be appealing to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. In an interview with Newsmax, Gohmert said he was optimistic about the appeal but said the judge\u2019s ruling meant that the only option left to those upset about the results of the election could be street violence. \u201cBottom line is, the court is saying, \u2018we\u2019re not going to touch this, you have no remedy,\u2019\u201d Gohmert said. \u201cBasically, in effect, the ruling would be that you\u2019ve got to go to the streets and be as violent as antifa and BLM.\u201d\nKernodle\u2019s ruling came a day after Pence, who was represented by Justice Department lawyers, called on him to reject the case, claiming that the arguments Gohmert was making meant he had to file suit against Congress, not the vice president. \u201cA suit to establish that the Vice President has discretion over the count, filed against the Vice President, is a walking legal contradiction,\u201d wrote the Justice Department lawyer.

Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) and other plaintiffs seeking clarification on what power the vice president has during congressional sessions for counting electoral votes filed an appeal late Friday after a judge dismissed their case.\nDistrict Judge Jeremy Kernodle, a Trump appointee, ruled earlier in the day that the plaintiffs in Gohmert v. Pence lack standing.\nPlaintiffs were seeking a court ruling that would uphold their view that the vice president has the \u201cexclusive authority\u201d to decide between competing slates of electors. They allege the Electoral Count Act of 1877 violates the Constitution because it restrains the vice president\u2019s authority.\nVice President Mike Pence and Democrats aligned in asking the court to reject the suit, because, they argued among other reasons, it named the wrong defendant.\nAccording to a notice filed with the court, the plaintiffs shortly before midnight filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The 6-page notice included no arguments.\nVice President Mike Pence looks on during a press conference at the White House in Washington on March 2, 2020. (Charlotte Cuthbertson/The Epoch Times)\nGohmert said late Friday that Kernodle\u2019s ruling was wrong and plaintiffs hoped to get an answer from the appeals court before Jan. 6, when the joint session of Congress is set to take place.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my hope and prayer.

They\u2019re targeting crucial swing states where Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden won, including Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Nevada. President Donald Trump claims he actually won the states.\nThe group grew by 11 on Saturday.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. Vice President Mike Pence speaks after receiving the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine at the White House in Washington, U.S., December 18, 2020. REUTERS/Cheriss May The latest long-shot attempt by Trump\u2019s Republican allies to overturn the Nov. 3 election was dismissed by one of Trump\u2019s own appointees to the federal bench, Jeremy Kernodle. He ruled that U.S. Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas and a slate of Republican electors from Arizona could not show they suffered any personal harm \u201cfairly traceable\u201d to Pence\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct and, therefore, lacked legal standing to bring the case. The standing requirement \u201chelps enforce the limited role of federal courts in our constitutional system. The problem for plaintiffs here is that they lack standing,\u201d Kernodle wrote. A spokesman for Trump referred questions to Pence\u2019s office. A spokesman for Pence declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Gohmert did not immediately comment. Trump has refused to concede defeat to Democrat Biden and has repeatedly falsely claimed the election was tainted by widespread fraud. He and his allies have lost dozens of court efforts seeking to reverse the election results. Biden beat President Donald Trump by a 306-232 margin in the Electoral College and is set to be sworn in on Jan. 20. Under the Electoral College system, \u201celectoral votes\u201d are allotted to states and the District of Columbia based on their congressional representation. Gohmert\u2019s suit argued that Pence had discretion to decide what votes should count. They also asked the judge to bar Pence from following the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which lays out how objections to votes are handled by Congress. Some Republicans have said they plan to object to the count of presidential electors next week in Congress. Reuters reported this week the effort could trigger a lengthy debate in the Senate but has virtually no chance of overturning the results. A Justice Department lawyer representing Pence on Thursday urged Kernodle to dismiss the lawsuit saying they had sued the wrong person as they raised \u201ca host of weighty legal issues about the manner in which the electoral votes for president are to be counted.\u201d \u201cThe Senate and the House, not the Vice President, have legal interests that are sufficiently adverse to plaintiffs to ground a case or controversy,\u201d Pence\u2019s filing said.",
        "summarized_context": "A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by Rep.

The judge ruled that Gohmert and his fellow Republicans lacked standing to sue and that their claim was speculative and based on hypotheticals. However, the judge left the door open for Gohmert to reframe the lawsuit and pursue it in court. Gohmert and the other plaintiffs have said they will appeal the ruling. The lawsuit does not affect the plans of 52 members of Congress to object to electoral votes during the congressional session."

            "\u00a9 Provided by Associated Press President Donald Trump speaks during an event on judicial appointments, in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House, Wednesday, Sept. 9, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Hoping to replicate a strategy long seen as key to his appeal among conservative voters, President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced he is adding 20 names to a list of Supreme Court candidates he's pledged to choose from if he has future vacancies to fill.\nThe list includes a trio of conservative Republican senators: Ted Cruz of Texas, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 all buzzed-about potential 2024 Republican presidential candidates \u2014 as well as Christopher Landau, the current ambassador to Mexico, and Noel Francisco, who argued 17 cases as the Trump administration\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer.\n\u201cEvery one of these individuals will ensure equal justice, equal treatment and equal rights for citizens of every race, color, religion and creed,\u201d Trump said as he made his announcement at the White House.\nTrump tried to cast the list in contrast with judges who could be nominated if his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, wins in November, warning Biden would select \u201cradical justices\u201d who would \u201cfundamentally transform America without a single vote of Congress,\u201d even though Biden has never outlined his list of potential picks and the Senate must confirm any nominee.\nThe release, less than two months before the election, is aimed at repeating the strategy that Trump employed during his 2016 campaign, when he released a similar list of could-be judges in a bid to win over conservative and evangelical voters who had doubts about his conservative bonafides.\nThe list includes a number of people who have worked for Trump's administration, including Gregory Katsas, whom Trump nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Before that, Katsas served as a legal adviser on some of the president\u2019s most contentious policies, including his executive orders restricting travel for citizens of predominantly Muslim countries and his decision to end a program protecting some young immigrants from deportation.\n\u00a9 Provided by Associated Press FILE - In this June 29, 2020, file photo, the Supreme Court is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington. President Donald Trump is preparing to release a list of potential Supreme Court nominees. It's a list that will give voters something to compare to rival Joe Biden\u2019s promise to nominate a Black woman to the high court if given the chance. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)\nFrancisco, the former solicitor general of the United States, also defended Trump\u2019s travel ban, his unsuccessful push to add a citizenship question to the U.S. census and the decision to wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that protects hundreds of thousands of young people from deportation. He also argued that a landmark civil rights law didn\u2019t protect gay, lesbian and transgender people from employment discrimination, a position the court ruled against 6-3 earlier this year.\nAlso on the list is Daniel Cameron, the Kentucky Attorney General who is currently deciding whether to criminally charge three Louisville police officers in the March shooting death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black emergency medical technician who was killed when officers entered her apartment with a no-knock warrant during a drug investigation.\nIn response, Cotton tweeted that he was \u201chonored\u201d Trump had asked him to consider the role and \u201cwill always heed the call of service to our nation.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Roe v. Wade to go,\u201d he added, referring to the court's landmark 1973 abortion rights decision.\nHawley, however, said he had already made clear to the president and his staff on multiple occasions that he had \u201cno interest\u201d in the role.\nThe high court is currently divided 5-4 between conservatives and liberals. While there is no current vacancy on the court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 87, has been undergoing cancer treatment, and three others members of the court are in their 70s and 80s.\nTrump has already remade the federal bench for a generation, with the Republican Senate confirming more than 200 of his judicial nominees. And any vacancy in the highest court would give November's winner \u2014 be it Trump or Biden \u2014 the ability to shape its future for decades to come.\nTrump has stressed that power on the campaign trail, claiming the person who wins could have \u201danywhere from two to four, to maybe even five\u201d Supreme Court justices to pick, though that would require an extraordinary level of turnover.\nTrump released two lists with a total of 21 names of potential Supreme Court nominees during his previous presidential campaign and added another five names in 2017 after becoming president. Trump\u2019s two nominees to the court, Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, were both drawn from the list.\nEven in a race reshaped by the pandemic and the national reckoning over race, Trump's frequently references the appointments in campaign speeches and continues to highlight the brutal fight around Kavanaugh's nomination as he tries to replicate the excitement it generated on the right and make the race an us-vs.-them battle over American values and cancel culture.\n\u201cDid you ever see anything like that?\u201d Trump told a rally crowd last month in New Hampshire.\nFor the president's allies, the list \u2014- which Trump finalized Wednesday \u2014 is seen as a way to excite his base as well as well as remind voters of what's at stake come November.\n\u201cI think it's very important way for the president to reaffirm his commitment to an issue that many conservatives and Republicans see as a priority,\u201d said Leonard Leo, the longtime executive vice president of the conservative Federalist Society who helped with the Kavanaugh and Gorsuch confirmations. \u201cThis a great way to remind people of the legacy he\u2019s already established for himself in this area.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s rival for the presidency, former vice president Biden, has promised to nominate a Black woman to the high court if given the chance. Biden, too, has said he\u2019s working on a list of potential nominees, but the campaign has given no indication that it will release names before the election. Democrats believe doing so would unnecessarily distract from Biden\u2019s focus on Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic and the economy, while also giving the president and his allies fresh targets to attack.\nTrump, however, insisted that presidential candidates \u201cowe the American people\u201d a list of whom they'd consider because, aside from \u201cmatters of war and peace, the nomination of a Supreme Court justice is the most important decision an American president can make.\u201d\nAny list may be meaningless, however. Either man\u2019s ability to add to the court depends on having a majority in the Senate, which confirms nominees. Republicans currently hold 53 seats in the chamber to Democrats\u2019 45, with two independents who caucus with the Democrats, but Democrats could reclaim the majority this November.\nThe court\u2019s oldest members are Justice Ginsburg and Justice Stephen Breyer, 82, both liberals, and Justice Clarence Thomas, 72, and Justice Samuel Alito, 70, two conservatives. Ginsburg made news this summer when she announced she is being treated for a recurrence of cancer but has no plans to step down as long as she can still do the job.\nTrump and the White House have been careful not to appear too eager for Ginsburg to retire, but Trump has said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d nominate a new justice should a vacancy arise during the remainder of his term.\nWhile all presidents tend to look for the same characteristics in potential Supreme Court picks, including stellar legal credentials, nearly half of those named by Trump Wednesday are non-judges. Of the 11 judges on the list, 10 were nominated by Trump to their current posts. Women represent less than a third.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Zeke Miller in Washington and Jonathan Lemire in New York contributed to this report.",
            "President Trump unveiled a list of individuals he will potentially nominate for the Supreme Court, a move likely to rally evangelical voters and core conservatives in his base before the election.\nDuring a Wednesday press conference at the White House, Trump revealed an additional 20 potential nominees to a list he previously released during the 2016 presidential campaign. Among those added include 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Bridget S. Bade, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, and Republican Sens. Tom Cotton, Ted Cruz, and Josh Hawley, whom Trump described as being in the mold of conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito and former Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\u201dOur cherished rights are at risk, including the right to life and our great Second Amendment. Over the next four years, America's president will choose hundreds of federal judges and, in all likelihood, one, two, three, and even four Supreme Court justices,\u201d Trump said. \u201dThe outcome of these decisions will determine whether we hold fast to our nation's founding principles or whether they are lost forever.\u201d\nFollowing the announcement, the conservative senators had varying reactions, but all thanked the president for considering them as options for the high court.\n\u201cI am grateful for the president\u2019s confidence in me and for his leadership in nominating principled constitutionalists to the federal bench over the last four years. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I\u2019ve been proud to help confirm to the bench over 200 of President Trump\u2019s judicial nominees, including two to the Supreme Court.

At a White House event, Trump announced a list of 20 potential justices, saying they all would preserve America\u2019s \u201cfounding principles.\u201d The Republican president also urged his Democratic election rival, Joe Biden, to release his own list. Trump\u2019s list included Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Tom Cotton of Arkansas. Hawley told reporters he had told Trump he was \u201cnot interested in the job.\u201d Most of the names on the new list are judges whom Trump already has appointed to lower federal courts. Others include: Noel Francisco, who served until recently as the Trump administration\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer; Daniel Cameron, Kentucky\u2019s attorney general; and Paul Clement, the top Supreme Court lawyer under former Republican President George W. Bush and now one of the most prominent private attorneys who argues cases before the justices. A senior administration official told Reuters that Trump had sought people from a diverse area of the country - 13 states plus Washington, D.C. - along with a diversity of originating law schools for the people on the new list, and noted that women and minorities made up 11 names on the list. The Supreme Court\u2019s 5-4 conservative majority includes two justices appointed by Trump. His release of a new list - names added to another roster he issued earlier in his presidency - was aimed at reassuring conservatives and generating enthusiasm among them ahead of the election. It brought to 44 the number of different potential nominees Trump has said he would consider. U.S. President Donald Trump takes questions after delivering remarks on judicial appointments during a brief appearance in the Diplomatic Room at the White House in Washington, U.S., September 9, 2020. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst If a vacancy emerges soon, the favorites likely would be some of those on Trump\u2019s previous list, including Amy Coney Barrett, a judge on the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. AN AGING BENCH An additional vacancy could enable Trump to move the court further to the right. Four of the nine justices are age 70 or older: liberals Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 87, and Stephen Breyer, 82, and conservatives Clarence Thomas, 72, and Samuel Alito, 70. Ginsburg has experienced recurring health problems. Supreme Court justices, who receive lifetime appointments, play an enormous role in shaping U.S. policies on hot-button issues such as abortion, LGBT rights, gun rights, religious liberty, the death penalty and presidential powers. If Ginsburg or Breyer were to step down and Trump was able to appoint a successor, the court would have a rock-solid 6-3 conservative majority - or even a 7-2 advantage if both were replaced. That could deliver changes long sought by conservatives such as overturning the court\u2019s landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. The court would also be a conservative bulwark should liberal Democrats in the future have the votes to pass sweeping legislation on such issues as climate change and healthcare. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer slammed Trump\u2019s list of possible picks. \u201cThese radical nominees would continue the effort to reverse important progress America has made over the last 50 years on women\u2019s reproductive freedom, strip away critical healthcare protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions, and gut labor, environmental, and civil rights,\u201d Schumer said in a statement. Trump\u2019s two appointees to the court were Neil Gorsuch in 2017 and Brett Kavanaugh in 2018. Trump\u2019s ability to appoint justices is reliant not just on him winning re-election but on Republicans retaining control of the U.S. Senate, which has the job of confirming federal judicial nominations. Under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate confirmation of Trump nominees to the federal judiciary has been a paramount priority. As a candidate in 2016, Trump also unveiled a list of potential nominees in bid at the time to win over skeptical conservatives. Trump and his allies have criticized conservative Chief Justice John Roberts. Roberts sided this year with the court\u2019s liberals in three high-profile rulings that backed LGBT worker rights, thwarted Trump\u2019s bid to rescind protections for illegal immigrants dubbed \u201cDreamers\u201d who entered the United States as children, and struck down a restrictive Louisiana abortion law.",
        "summarized_context": "President Donald Trump has released a list of 20 potential Supreme Court nominees, including Republican senators Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton, and Josh Hawley. The move is seen as an attempt to rally conservative voters ahead of the election. Trump emphasized the importance of the Supreme Court in shaping the future of the country and warned that his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, would select \"radical justices\" if elected. Trump's list includes a mix of judges and non-judges, with nearly half of the nominees being non-judges. Trump has already appointed two Supreme Court justices during his presidency."

He said his remarks were also cleared by lawyers at the State Department.\nBut Democrats have homed in on what they say is Pompeo's obvious politicization of the State Department, arguing that his speech to the convention, recorded from Jerusalem and while on official diplomatic travel, was in violation of the Hatch Act and the secretary's own State Department guidelines prohibiting staff from participating in partisan events.\nThey launched their own investigation in August over potential Hatch Act violations.\nThe OSC probe into Pompeo's convention speech follows the revelation last week that the independent federal watchdog opened a case file into potential Hatch Act violations over Pompeo's promise to release emails related to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private server.\nThe case file was opened in response to a request by American Oversight, an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit ethics watchdog group.\nPompeo, in response to a complaint by President Trump in an interview on Fox Business earlier this month, has said he would work to release Clinton's emails.\n\u201dWe'll produce them when they are prepared to be produced,\u201d Pompeo said in a briefing with reporters last week.\nDemocrats have also taken issue with Pompeo's speeches to domestic audiences in key swing states weeks before the Nov. 3 presidential election, saying the secretary is stumping for Trump.\nThis includes a speech to the Wisconsin Legislature on Sept. 24 and a baptist church in Texas on Sept. 20.

A Senate vote later Friday to officially pass the bill will be similarly overwhelming, CNN's Manu Raju reports, invalidating President Trump's promise to veto it.\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) had filibustered the National Defense Authorization Act, passed every year to fund the Pentagon, over provisions that would make it harder for Trump to reduce troops in Afghanistan and Germany, Military Times reports. He also clotheslined a stopgap funding measure meant to prevent a government shutdown for another week as Congress continues to debate coronavirus relief and a government funding bill. The House has already overwhelmingly passed both the stopgap measure and the defense bill.\nTrump has been pledging for months that he'd reject the defense bill if it included a provision to rename military bases named after Confederate leaders. Discussions over renaming the bases swelled over the summer during protests against police brutality and America's systemic racism. Trump has insisted that the Confederate names actually represent America's \u201dhistory of winning, victory, and freedom,\u201d despite basic facts about the Civil War that would suggest otherwise.

        "context": "(Updates throughout with comments, details) WASHINGTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Friday threw its weight behind the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a $740 billion bill setting policy for the Department of Defense, passing the bill with a margin large enough to overcome President Donald Trump\u2019s promised veto. The vote in the Republican-controlled Senate was 84 to 13, more than the two-thirds majority needed in the 100-member chamber needed to override a veto, a rare break between members of the president\u2019s party in Congress and the White House. The 13 \u2018no\u2019 votes were a mix of some of the most conservative Republicans and most liberal Democrats. The Democratic-led House of Representatives backed the NDAA by 335 to 78 earlier this week, also more than the two-thirds majority needed. Senate passage sends it to Trump\u2019s desk, weeks before he leaves office. Backers hope strong bipartisan support will prompt Trump to reconsider his threat to veto the bill, which has become law for 59 straight years. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, what this bill does,\u201d said Senator Jim Inhofe, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cIt makes our country more secure, and it supports our troops who defend it.\u201d The White House said Trump\u2019s position had not changed. The Republican president will have 10 days - minus Sundays - to veto, sign or allow it to become law without his signature. Trump objects to the fiscal 2021 NDAA because it does not repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects technology companies like Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc from liability for what appears on their platforms. Trump\u2019s threats frustrated lawmakers from both parties, who said the tech measure has nothing to do with defense. They also said Trump\u2019s concerns about social media should not kill legislation considered essential for the Pentagon and the result of nearly a year\u2019s work. Without providing significant evidence, Trump and supporters insist tech firms have an anti-conservative bias, which the companies deny. Anger over the issue intensified after Trump lost the Nov. 3 election. Trump also wants to block an NDAA provision stripping the names of Confederate generals from military bases. Trump says it disregards history, but supporters say it is long past time to stop honoring men who fought Union forces in the 1861-1865 Civil War in order to continue enslaving Black Americans. Trump opposes parts of the legislation that could slow plans to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and Germany, but such initiatives would be subject to review by the incoming administration of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden. The NDAA determines everything from how many ships are bought to soldiers\u2019 pay to how to address geopolitical threats. Because it is a compromise, combining separate measures already passed in the House and Senate, it cannot be amended and will expire on Jan. 3 if the veto is not overturned. A successful veto override would be the first of Trump\u2019s four-year presidency. He has had eight sustained. (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle, additional reporting by Steve Holland; editing by Philippa Fletcher and Rosalba O\u2019Brien)",
        "summarized_context": "The GOP-held Senate has voted 84-13 to defeat a filibuster holding up the passage of a $741 billion defense bill, which includes a provision to remove Confederate names from military bases. This is a blow to President Trump, who had promised to veto the bill if it included the provision. The Senate vote also signals that lawmakers have the two-thirds majority needed to override a potential veto. Trump has also demanded that the bill include a provision to strip lawsuit liability protection for Big Tech, but Republican leaders argue that this issue should not be tied to the defense bill."

            "\u00a9 Getty Images Biden leads Trump by 4 points in new Arizona poll\nDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden holds a 4-point lead over President Trump in Arizona, according to a Monmouth University poll released on Thursday.\nThe former vice president garnered 48 percent support in the survey, while Trump trailed at 44 percent. Biden's lead in the poll is just within the survey's margin of error.\nThe poll adds to a list of recent public surveys that show Biden with an edge in the fast-growing Sunbelt state, one that Trump carried in 2016 by 3.5 percentage points.\nA poll released earlier on Thursday by Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report found Biden with a 5-point lead in Arizona, prompting Cook to shift the state's rating from the toss-up column to \u201dlean Democrat.\u201d\nOne factor driving Biden's advantage in Arizona is his support among Latino voters. The Monmouth poll showed him leading Trump with those voters 63 percent to 33 percent. Then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won Arizona's Latino vote in 2016 by an identical 30-point margin, although she ultimately lost the state.\nBiden also holds a sizable lead in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix and its suburbs. The poll showed Biden garnering 50 percent support there to Trump's 41 percent. Trump carried the county by about 3 points four years ago.\nBeyond Maricopa, the poll shows Biden with a wide lead in the four counties that Clinton won in 2016 - Apache, Coconino, Pima and Santa Cruz - while Trump has a strong advantage in the other 10 counties he carried four years ago.\n\u201dBoth candidates are solidifying their support in the most partisan areas of the state, but the big prize is still Maricopa County. And we see a notable swing away from Trump there compared to four years ago,\u201d said Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.\nA win for Biden in Arizona would likely ease his path to 270 electoral votes significantly, allowing him to lose other battleground states like Michigan or Wisconsin and still amass enough votes to capture the White House as long as he wins the other states that Clinton carried in 2016.\nIn Arizona's hotly contested Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly holds a 6-point lead over Sen. Martha McSally (R), the poll shows. He garnered 50 percent support to the incumbent's 44 percent.\nOpinions of Kelly are largely positive, with 48 percent of registered voters reporting a favorable view of the candidate and 29 percent saying they see him unfavorably. Views of McSally, meanwhile, are split, with 40 percent saying they view her favorably and 42 percent reporting an unfavorable opinion.\nMcSally is among the most vulnerable GOP senators seeking reelection this year, along with incumbents in Colorado, North Carolina and Maine. Democrats need to flip three or four Senate seats this year, depending on which party wins the White House, in order to capture a majority in the chamber.\nThe Monmouth University survey of 420 registered voters in Arizona was conducted Sept. 11-15 and has a margin of error of 4.8 percentage points.",

The FiveThirtyEight polling average in Arizona shows Biden with a 4.8-point edge over Trump.\nThe KFF-Cook poll carries some troubling signs for Trump\u2019s reelection bid. Republican voters in the state aren\u2019t as firm in their support of Trump as they are in Florida and North Carolina, with only about 73 percent saying they will definitely vote for the president in November. Another 9 percent said they will either probably or definitely cast their ballot for Biden.\nTrump\u2019s support among Latinos in Arizona is also lagging. The poll showed him garnering just 17 percent support among those voters to Biden\u2019s 55 percent. In 2016, Trump captured 31 percent of the Latino vote in Arizona.\nTrump\u2019s trouble in Arizona also owes in part to defections by suburban voters in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix and its suburbs. Biden now leads there by 6 points, according to the KFF-Cook poll. Trump won the county in 2016 by about 3 points.\nIf Biden wins Arizona in November, it would significantly ease his path to 270 electoral votes.

            "\u00a9 Provided by The Canadian Press\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Democratic-controlled House easily approved a wide-ranging defence policy bill, defying a veto threat from President Donald Trump and setting up a possible showdown with the Republican president in the waning days of his administration.\nThe 335-78 vote in favour of the $731 billion defence measure came on Tuesday hours after Trump renewed his threat to veto the bill unless lawmakers clamp down on social media companies he claims were biased against him during the election.\nTrump tweeted Tuesday that he will veto \u201dthe very weak National Defence Authorization Act,'' or NDAA, unless it repeals so-called Section 230, a part of the communications code that shields Twitter, Facebook and other tech giants from content liability. Trump also wants Congress to strip out a provision of the bill that allows renaming of military bases that now honour Confederate leaders.\nCongressional leaders vowed to move ahead on the hugely popular bill \u2014 which affirms automatic 3% pay raises for U.S. troops and authorizes other military programs \u2014 despite the veto threat.\nThe final vote represented approval from more than 80% of the House \u2014 well above the two-thirds support required to override a potential veto. A total of 140 Republicans joined 195 Democrats to back the bill, which now goes to the Senate.\nWyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, a member of the House Republican leadership, urged Trump not to follow through on his veto threat, but added that if he does veto it, \u201dWe should override.''\nIf Trump vetoes the bill, \u201dwe will come back to vote to override,\u201d said Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.\nBut with Trump pressuring Republicans to stand with him, it was unclear until the final tally whether the bill would receive the two-thirds support needed to override a veto. The House Freedom Caucus, a bloc of roughly three-dozen conservatives, backed Trump's position Tuesday and opposed the bill.\n\u201cWe stand with the president,'' said Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., the group's chairman. \u201dThis particular NDAA bill is filled with flaws and problems,'' including limitations on troop withdrawals ordered by Trump in Afghanistan and Germany, Biggs said.\nSmith and other lawmakers noted that many defence programs can only go into effect if the bill is approved, including military construction. The measure guides Pentagon policy and cements decisions about troop levels, new weapons systems and military readiness, military personnel policy and other military goals.\nTroops should not be \u201cpunished\u201d because politicians failed to enact needed legislation to ensure their pay, said Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the Armed Services panel. The $731 billion measure increases hazardous duty pay for overseas deployments and other dangerous job assignments, hikes recruiting and retention bonuses and adjusts housing allowances.\nThe dispute over social media content \u2014 a battle cry of conservatives who say the social media giants treat them unfairly \u2014 interjects an unrelated but complicated issue into a bill that Congress takes pride in having passed unfailingly for nearly 60 years. It follows Trump's bid to sabotage the package with an earlier veto threat over Confederate base names.\nMeasures approved by the House and Senate would require the Pentagon to rename bases such as Fort Benning and Fort Hood named for Confederate generals, but Trump opposes the idea and has threatened a veto over it. The fight erupted this summer amid widespread protests over police killings of unarmed Black men and women, and Trump used the debate to try to appeal to white Southern voters nostalgic about the Confederacy.\nSmith and Thornberry said in a joint statement last week that lawmakers had \u201dtoiled through almost 2,200 provisions to reach compromise on important issues affecting our national security and our military.\u201d\nFor 59 straight years, they added, the NDAA has passed because lawmakers and presidents agreed to set aside their own preferences \u201cand put the needs of our military personnel and America\u2019s security first. The time has come to do that again.\u201d\nThe powerful Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, said he had spoken to Trump and explained that the defence bill is not the place for the big tech fight.\n\u201cI agree with his sentiments \u2014 we ought to do away with 230,\u201d Inhofe told reporters. \u201cBut you can\u2019t do it in this bill.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s veto threat in the final months of his administration is his latest attempt to bend the norms. From redirecting money intended for military bases to build the border wall with Mexico to installing acting nominees in administrative positions without Senate confirmation, Trump has chipped away at the legislative branch throughout his term.\nIf he does veto the defence bill, Congress could cut short its Christmas recess to hold override votes, senior House members said.\n\u201cI think we can override the veto, if in fact he vetoes,'' House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said Tuesday before the vote. \u201cI hope he does not veto, I hope he reconsiders. And I think he will get substantial pressure, advice (from Republicans) that, you know, you don\u2019t want to put the defence bill at risk.''\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump's attempt to pressure Congress on Section 230 was justified.\n\u201cTwitter has become a publisher, choosing to fact-check content,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re a publisher, there are certain responsibilities with that and you should not be immune from liability.\u201d\nPast presidents have certainly threatened to veto defence bills, which set annual policy with troop levels, equipment priorities, pay raises and other matters.\nThe defence bill is typically a widely bipartisan measure, one of the few areas of common ground. Over the summer, the Senate approved its version, 86-14, while the House similarly passed its effort, with opposition coming mostly from the liberal and conservative flanks.\nTrump\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, have railed against the social media companies, especially during the heated November election. McCarthy, R-Calif., voted for the bill Tuesday but said he would not support overriding the veto.\nSome Democrats, including Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, agree the Section 230 provision could be revisited, even as they disagree with Trump\u2019s tactic of attaching it to the defence bill.\nMatthew Daly, The Associated Press",
            "The House voted overwhelmingly to pass a critical defense bill that President Trump has threatened to veto because it lacks new language that would punish social media firms.\nThe 335-78 vote provided enough support for the National Defense Authorization Act to override Trump\u2019s promised veto.\nBut Republicans who voted for the bill Tuesday signaled they may vote to uphold Trump\u2019s expected rejection, among them House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican and close Trump ally. McCarthy voted in favor of the bill Tuesday but said he will not vote to override a veto from Trump.\nThe defense measure now heads for the Senate, where lawmakers are expected to pass it this week.\nTrump has repeatedly pledged to veto the bill because lawmakers declined his request to include a provision to strip out lawsuit liability protection for Big Tech.\nTrump and many Republicans believe Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provides the broad lawsuit protections to sites such as Twitter and Facebook, needs reform or complete elimination due to the actions of those social media platforms and others to censure or block conservatives on their sites.\nTrump said Tuesday he would veto the bill over the Section 230 language and other provisions he said are missing from the bill.\n\u201dI hope House Republicans will vote against the very weak National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which I will VETO,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201dMust include a termination of Section 230 (for National Security purposes), preserve our National Monuments, & allow for 5G & troop reductions in foreign lands!\u201d\nRepublican leaders say they agree with the president about reforming Section 230 but said the effort to change the law should not be entangled with the annual defense policy bill, which the military relies on for critical planning.\nMembers of the House Freedom Caucus announced Tuesday they would vote to oppose the bill over the missing Big Tech language and for other reasons, including a lack of a pay increase for members of the military, which they want included in the legislation.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said he backs the defense bill and will take up a veto override vote on the Senate floor, but only after the House successfully overrides it, which is not a certainty.\nDozens of Democrats joined the members of the Freedom Caucus and voted against the measure Tuesday.\nIf McCarthy and many more Republicans vote along with this group, it could be difficult for the House to come up with the roughly 286 votes needed to push the bill into law over Trump\u2019s veto.\nForty Republicans and 37 Democrats voted against the bill Tuesday.\n\u201cIt is my hope that the President signs the FY21 NDAA into law given how important passage is for our service members and their families,\u201d House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat, said Tuesday. \u201cHowever I remain confident that Congress will exercise our authority to override a potential veto should he choose to put his ego first.\u201d"

(Greg Nash/Pool via AP) FILE - In this July 9, 2020 file photo, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., speaks to Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, during a House Armed Services Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Greg Nash/Pool via AP) WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Democratic-controlled House on Tuesday easily approved a wide-ranging defense policy bill, defying a veto threat from President Donald Trump and setting up a possible showdown with the Republican president in the waning days of his administration. The 335-78 vote in favor of the $731 billion defense measure came hours after Trump renewed his threat to veto the bill unless lawmakers clamp down on social media companies he claims were biased against him during the election. Trump tweeted Tuesday that he will veto \u201cthe very weak National Defense Authorization Act,\u2033 or NDAA, unless it repeals so-called Section 230, a part of the communications code that shields Twitter, Facebook and other tech giants from content liability. Trump also wants Congress to strip out a provision of the bill that allows renaming of military bases that now honor Confederate leaders. ADVERTISEMENT Congressional leaders vowed to move ahead on the hugely popular bill \u2014 which affirms automatic 3% pay raises for U.S. troops and authorizes other military programs \u2014 despite the veto threat. The final vote represented approval from more than 80% of the House \u2014 well above the two-thirds support required to override a potential veto. A total of 140 Republicans joined 195 Democrats to back the bill, which now goes to the Senate. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, a member of the House Republican leadership, urged Trump not to follow through on his veto threat, but added that if he does veto it, \u201cWe should override.\u2033 If Trump vetoes the bill, \u201cwe will come back to vote to override,\u201d said Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. But with Trump pressuring Republicans to stand with him, it was unclear until the final tally whether the bill would receive the two-thirds support needed to override a veto. The House Freedom Caucus, a bloc of roughly three-dozen conservatives, backed Trump\u2019s position Tuesday and opposed the bill. \u201cWe stand with the president,\u2033 said Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., the group\u2019s chairman. \u201cThis particular NDAA bill is filled with flaws and problems,\u2033 including limitations on troop withdrawals ordered by Trump in Afghanistan and Germany, Biggs said. Smith and other lawmakers noted that many defense programs can only go into effect if the bill is approved, including military construction. The measure guides Pentagon policy and cements decisions about troop levels, new weapons systems and military readiness, military personnel policy and other military goals. Troops should not be \u201cpunished\u201d because politicians failed to enact needed legislation to ensure their pay, said Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the Armed Services panel. The $731 billion measure increases hazardous duty pay for overseas deployments and other dangerous job assignments, hikes recruiting and retention bonuses and adjusts housing allowances. The dispute over social media content \u2014 a battle cry of conservatives who say the social media giants treat them unfairly \u2014 interjects an unrelated but complicated issue into a bill that Congress takes pride in having passed unfailingly for nearly 60 years. It follows Trump\u2019s bid to sabotage the package with an earlier veto threat over Confederate base names. ADVERTISEMENT Measures approved by the House and Senate would require the Pentagon to rename bases such as Fort Benning and Fort Hood named for Confederate generals, but Trump opposes the idea and has threatened a veto over it. The fight erupted this summer amid widespread protests over police killings of unarmed Black men and women , and Trump used the debate to try to appeal to white Southern voters nostalgic about the Confederacy. Smith and Thornberry said in a joint statement last week that lawmakers had \u201ctoiled through almost 2,200 provisions to reach compromise on important issues affecting our national security and our military.\u201d For 59 straight years, they added, the NDAA has passed because lawmakers and presidents agreed to set aside their own preferences \u201cand put the needs of our military personnel and America\u2019s security first. The time has come to do that again.\u201d The powerful Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, said he had spoken to Trump and explained that the defense bill is not the place for the big tech fight. \u201cI agree with his sentiments \u2014 we ought to do away with 230,\u201d Inhofe told reporters. \u201cBut you can\u2019t do it in this bill.\u201d Trump\u2019s veto threat in the final months of his administration is his latest attempt to bend the norms . From redirecting money intended for military bases to build the border wall with Mexico to installing acting nominees in administrative positions without Senate confirmation, Trump has chipped away at the legislative branch throughout his term. If he does veto the defense bill, Congress could cut short its Christmas recess to hold override votes, senior House members said. \u201cI think we can override the veto, if in fact he vetoes,\u2033 House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said Tuesday before the vote. \u201cI hope he does not veto, I hope he reconsiders. And I think he will get substantial pressure, advice (from Republicans) that, you know, you don\u2019t want to put the defense bill at risk.\u2033 White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump\u2019s attempt to pressure Congress on Section 230 was justified. \u201cTwitter has become a publisher, choosing to fact-check content,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re a publisher, there are certain responsibilities with that and you should not be immune from liability.\u201d Past presidents have certainly threatened to veto defense bills, which set annual policy with troop levels, equipment priorities, pay raises and other matters. The defense bill is typically a widely bipartisan measure, one of the few areas of common ground. Over the summer, the Senate approved its version, 86-14, while the House similarly passed its effort, with opposition coming mostly from the liberal and conservative flanks. Trump\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, have railed against the social media companies, especially during the heated November election. McCarthy, R-Calif., voted for the bill Tuesday but said he would not support overriding the veto. Some Democrats, including Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, agree the Section 230 provision could be revisited, even as they disagree with Trump\u2019s tactic of attaching it to the defense bill.",
        "summarized_context": "The Democratic-controlled House has passed a $731 billion defense policy bill, despite a veto threat from President Donald Trump. The bill received a 335-78 vote in favor and now heads to the Senate. Trump has threatened to veto the bill unless it includes provisions to punish social media companies and remove liability protection for Big Tech. Republican leaders agree with Trump on the need to reform Section 230, but believe it should not be tied to the defense bill. It remains uncertain whether there will be enough support to override a potential veto in both the House and Senate."

But CNN reports that investigators \u201dhave been examining multiple financial issues, including whether Hunter Biden and associates violated tax and money laundering laws in business dealings in foreign countries, principally China.\u201d CNN also reports the investigation \u201dbegan as early as 2018.\u201d Brendan Morrow",
            "EXCLUSIVE: Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, who has been looking into Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business dealings for over a year, told Fox News on Wednesday he opposes the appointment of a special counsel to investigate President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s son, while vowing to continue looking into the matter.\nJohnson's comments come after it became public that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Delaware has been investigating Hunter Biden's \u201dtax affairs.\u201d\n\u201dI learned yesterday for the first time that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Delaware advised my legal counsel, also yesterday, that they are investigating my tax affairs,\u201d Hunter Biden said in a statement Wednesday. \u201dI take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors.\u201d\nHUNTER BIDEN 'TAX AFFAIRS' UNDER FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\nThe investigation, according to a source familiar with the matter, began in 2018.\nJohnson, the Republican senior senator from Wisconsin, during an interview with Fox News, said he \u201dwill be watching\u201d that federal probe \u201dvery carefully.\u201d\n\u201dI will give whoever is investigating this the benefit of the doubt, but I will certainly be suspicious of an investigation similar to Midyear Exam,\u201d Johnson said, referring to the FBI's investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. \u201dThat was meant to cover up the truth and exonerate, as opposed to uncover and prosecute.\u201d\nHe added: \u201dI will cross my fingers and hope that is not what this is about, and does not turn into, under a Biden administration.\u201d\nPrior to Hunter Biden confirming he was under federal investigation, Fox News reported earlier this week that Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., urged Attorney General Bill Barr to appoint a special counsel to review the younger Biden's overseas business dealings, and the contents of a laptop purportedly belonging to him.\nGOP REP. KEN BUCK URGES BARR TO APPOINT SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE HUNTER BIDEN FOREIGN BUSINESS DEALINGS, LAPTOP\nBut Johnson disagreed.\n\u201dTo single out one individual with a special counsel -- I don't think that's necessary unless more information comes to light,\u201d Johnson told Fox News. \u201dI'm just not a fan of special counsels\u2014I don't care if it's a special counsel against a Republican president or a Democratic one.\u201d\nJohnson said that special counsels have been \u201dreserved for serious business -- really big business.\u201d\nJohnson noted that he was \u201dnot downplaying\u201d Hunter Biden's business dealings, but said it was not the same situation as \u201dcorruption of the FBI.\u201d\nEarlier this month, Barr made public that he appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham from Connecticut as a special counsel to continue investigating the origins of the Trump-Russia probe.\n\u201dHunter Biden is not the same as corruption within the FBI,\u201d Johnson said. \u201dThat is a really big issue that requires a special counsel.\u201d\n\u201dBut, financial dealings, improper, proper, illegal, legal of the son of a former vice president, or son of an eventual president, normal prosecutors can handle that together with an investigative press and Congress,\u201d Johnson said.\n\u201dI'm not going to turn a blind eye on this,\u201d he continued, noting that he already has requested a slew of additional documents and financial transactions from the Treasury Department. \u201dWe'll keep digging.\u201d\nHe added: \u201dWhenever there is a criminal investigation, that limits access Congress has.\u201d\nJohnson also said, however, that if his committee \u201dcontinues to get stonewalled or the stonewalling gets worse, I may change my opinion.\u201d\nJohnson's committee has been investigating Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings since 2019, and this past September released an interim report on its months' long probe into Hunter Biden's role on the board of Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma and his alleged \u201dextensive and complex financial transactions.\u201d\nJohnson and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said their investigation has \u201dfaced many obstacles\u201d from Democrats on their committees and that executive agencies \u201dfailed to comply with document requests.\u201d The chairmen added that \u201dthere remains much work to be done\u201d in their probe.\nHunter Biden's work background played a starring role in the Trump impeachment efforts earlier this year. He and his father have denied any wrongdoing related to his work.\nHUNTER BIDEN EMAILS UNDER INVESTIGATION BY SENATE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE AFTER HARD DRIVE REPORT EMERGES\nThe 87-page report stated Obama administration officials \u201dknew\u201d that Hunter Biden\u2019s position on the board of Burisma was \u201dproblematic\u201d and that it interfered \u201din the efficient execution of policy with respect to Ukraine.\u201d\nThe report's executive summary stated, \u201dThis investigation has illustrated the extent to which officials within the Obama administration ignored the glaring warning signs when the vice president\u2019s son joined the board of a company owned by a corrupt Ukrainian oligarch.\u201d\nBiden\u2019s role on the board of Burisma and his business dealings emerged during the Trump impeachment inquiry in 2019.\nMeanwhile, in October, Fox News first reported that the FBI subpoenaed a laptop and hard drive purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden in connection with a money-laundering investigation in late 2019.\nIt was unclear whether the subpoenas came as part of the U.S. Attorney in Delaware's investigation into Biden\u2019s tax affairs. It also was unclear whether the FBI money laundering investigation was ongoing or directly related to Hunter Biden.\nOne document, obtained by Fox News, was a subpoena sent to the owner of the laptop repair shop to testify before U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on Dec. 9, 2019. One page of the subpoena showed what appeared to be serial numbers for a laptop and hard drive taken into possession.\nThe subpoena stated that it was requested by Lesley F. Wolf, who, at the time, served as assistant U.S. attorney for the district of Delaware.\nFox News also first reported in October that the FBI was in possession of the laptop in question.\nThe FBI has declined to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation into the laptop or the emails, as is standard practice.\nThe Justice Department declined to comment on the investigation into Biden's tax affairs.\nJohnson, though, noted, \u201dAny kind of criminal activity involving money is almost always going to have a tax element to it, because you could be hiding income.\u201d\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\u201dIt may be hard to prove whether a transaction is illegal, but you can always say you didn't report to your taxes,\u201d Johnson said. \u201dThat's how they got Al Capone.\u201d\nHe added: \u201dThis isn't going away.\u201d"

He said he learned of the investigation on Tuesday when prosecutors informed his lawyer of the probe. The transition team for President-elect Joe Biden on Wednesday released a statement saying Biden \u201cis deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.\u201d CNN reported that investigators have been examining multiple financial issues, including whether Hunter Biden and his associates violated tax and money laundering laws in business dealings in foreign countries, principally China, according to two people briefed on the probe. The investigation began as early as 2018, predating the arrival of William Barr as attorney general, two people briefed on the investigation told CNN. Reuters could not confirm the report. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment, and Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney could not immediately be reached for comment. Slideshow ( 2 images ) During the campaign, Trump and Republicans questioned potential conflicts of interest from Hunter Biden\u2019s position on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma at the time his father was vice president to Democratic President Barack Obama. Trump was impeached by the Democratic majority U.S. House of Representatives but acquitted by the Senate in February on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. Trump called during the campaign for China to investigate involvement of Biden\u2019s son in a fund that sought to raise Chinese capital. Trump accused Hunter Biden of using his position of influence to secure China\u2019s financial backing for his investments. Trump never provided evidence to support this claim, and Hunter Biden has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Joe Biden won the Nov. 3 election. Trump has filed numerous lawsuits to overturn the results; none have succeeded. A source familiar with the newly revealed investigation, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters \u201cthis is not related to the attacks the Trump team and their allies made against Hunter during the campaign.\u201d (This story corrects month of Trump\u2019s acquittal in Senate in 9th paragraph to February, not January)",

            "Iran and Russia are using voter registration data to interfere in the US elections, top national security officials announced during a surprise press conference Wednesday night.\nIran is behind the spoof emails to some voters, and is spreading disinformation online about sending fraudulent ballots from overseas, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said Wednesday. Russia has also gotten access to voter registration data, just as it did in 2016, he said.\nBoth Ratcliffe and FBI Director Christopher Wray said no votes have been compromised. \u201cToday, that [election] infrastructure remains resilient,\u201d Wray said Wednesday. \u201cYou should be confident that your vote counts.\u201d\nNational security officials didn\u2019t really offer many other details in their abrupt announcement. The spoof emails appear to be those sent to some voters in Alaska and Florida, which claimed to be sent from the Proud Boys, a far-right organization. The emails reportedly targeted Democratic voters, claiming they had access to voting infrastructure and threatening them if they did not vote for Trump.\nThe Washington Post reported before the press conference that the US government had concluded Iran was behind the emails.\nThreatening emails like this -- purporting to be from the Proud Boys -- are being sent to voters in Florida and Alaska.\n\nWe do not know who is behind them, but whoever it is is taking a lot of steps to mask their identity. https://t.co/cB3RpocA5i pic.twitter.com/NjYti0ufbe \u2014 Donie O'Sullivan (@donie) October 21, 2020\nOfficials did not elaborate on how they concluded Iran was behind the spoof emails and other disinformation, nor did they give many details about Russia\u2019s potential activities. Ratcliffe said the disinformation promoted by Iran was intended to \u201cincite social unrest\u201d and damage President Donald Trump, though, again he did not offer more details about that conclusion. Neither Ratcliffe nor Wray took questions.\nA person familiar with the intelligence told Vox that, with the email campaign, Iran intended to hurt Trump, but that is not necessarily true of all of their malign activities. But the idea here was \u201cto create a backlash against Trump because he\u2019s in bed with an abhorrent group.\u201d\nAll in all, it was a pretty odd press conference. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) has already warned the public against foreign interference in the 2020 election, much of which is designed to sow discord and undermine faith in the democratic process. So this kind of divisive, disinformation campaign was expected.\nAnd as many have pointed out, voter registration rolls are publicly available, and so it\u2019s not clear what exactly it means when officials say foreign actors obtained voter registration data. In 2016, Russia did target voting systems in all 50 states, though no voter information or votes were changed.\n\u201cVoter data, including partisan affiliation, is PUBLIC,\u201d David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, tweeted. \u201cEasy to get and in some cases free. The fact that this data is out there is NOT indication of any data breach.\u201d\nThe press conference is notable for what officials didn\u2019t say\nIn August, the ODNI named Russia, China, and Iran as the primary election interference threats. But each have different goals when it comes to foreign interference. As experts told me earlier this year, Russia is very much focused on creating chaos, while Iran and China are less eager to see the US in disarray, and more eager to push their national objectives.\nStill, Iran in the past has used social media to spread propaganda and divisive content, and based on Wednesday night\u2019s announcement, they\u2019re seeing an opening to go further in 2020.\n\u201cIn recent years, Iranian information operations have continued to push boundaries using bold and innovative approaches. However, this incident marks a fundamental shift in our understanding of Iran\u2019s willingness to interfere in the democratic process,\u201d John Hultquist, senior director of analysis for Mandiant Threat Intelligence, said in an emailed statement.\nThis kind of disinformation campaign doesn\u2019t take a whole lot of sophistication, though Iran\u2019s capabilities, especially when it comes to cyber operations, are not quite at the level of Russia and China.\nWhile officials did not go into details about what Russia was up to, the Kremlin is very much interfering in the 2020 election, spreading online disinformation, and by trying to plant denigrating information about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. And more questions have emerged after the New York Post published emails purportedly from Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, which were given to the paper by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Those emails were an attempt to drum up a scandal about Biden\u2019s dealings in Ukraine, which has continued to percolate in right-wing circles. Giuliani had also previously worked with Andrii Derkach, a Ukrainian politician that the US government sanctioned for interfering in the 2020 election.\nRatcliffe previously said that \u201cthere is no intelligence that supports\u201d that the Hunter Biden emails were \u201cpart of a Russian disinformation campaign.\u201d The FBI has told Congress it has \u201cnothing to add\u201d to Ratcliffe\u2019s statement.\nBut the authenticity and actual source of the emails (the story given to the New York Post about where the laptop came from, is well, something) is still unclear, and dozens of former intelligence officials have said the emails have all the \u201cearmarks\u201d of classic Russian disinformation.\nAgain, officials did not give any details Wednesday as to Russia\u2019s activities, and didn\u2019t address anything related to the Hunter Biden emails. But given the lingering questions around the story, the timing of a press conference to call out Iran and Russia is notable. When it comes to Iran, the Trump administration is also engaged in a maximum pressure campaign against the regime, and has consistently called attention to Iran\u2019s misdeeds as justification for sanctions and other tough measures.\nStill, all threats to intervene or meddle in the US elections are serious. Iran, or Russia, or anyone else are exploiting the divisions and partisan tensions already in US society, and with just two weeks before Election Day, much of it will be geared toward depressing turnout. As FBI Director Wray said Wednesday, the best place for accurate, up-to-date voter information is your state election officials. Because voters should know that it\u2019s only going to get worse from here until Election Day.\nAlex Ward contributed reporting to this story.\nWill you help keep Vox free for all?\nThe United States is in the middle of one of the most consequential presidential elections of our lifetimes.

U.S. intelligence agencies previously warned that Iran might interfere to hurt Trump and that Russia was trying to help him in the election. Outside experts said that if Ratcliffe was correct, Iran would be trying to make Trump look bad by calling attention to support and threats by the sometimes violent group.

Some of those emails also contained a video, debunked by experts, that purported to show how fake ballots could be submitted. Ratcliffe said that claim was false.

He can decertify the results or send them back to the states for change and certification.\u201d Trump\u2019s statement and tweet put more pressure on Pence, whose future political prospects are tied largely to his ability to please the president\u2019s base of supporters. But advisers said on Tuesday night that the vice president\u2019s thinking about his role had not changed. Trump\u2019s pressure campaign against his vice president took off at a campaign rally for Republican U.S. Senate incumbents in Georgia on Monday night when he expressed hope that Pence would take action. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t come through, I won\u2019t like him quite as much,\u201d Trump said. About a dozen Republican senators, as well as dozens of Republicans in the House, plan to object to the certification of the Electoral College results in Congress on Wednesday. The move has virtually no chance of overturning Biden\u2019s victory. \u2018WILL UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION\u2019 Current and former White House aides said the vice president planned to perform his ceremonial duties. \u201cHe will be very supportive of the president, but again he\u2019ll stick to the Constitution,\u201d one former White House official who has regular contact with Pence\u2019s team told Reuters.

It is opening up envelopes and reading the contents of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short, told Reuters on Monday that the vice president \u201cwill uphold the Constitution and follow the statutory law.\u201d On Friday, a Trump-appointed judge rejected a lawsuit brought by Republican members of Congress asking Pence to reject Electoral College results, saying they had no standing for such a suit.

Biden capitalized on Atlanta\u2019s population boom and the diversity of the surrounding suburbs to offset Republicans\u2019 advantage in rural parts of the state.\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have been campaigning in tandem. But the stakes are higher for Ossoff and Warnock: If just one fails to knock off either Perdue or Loeffler, who are campaigning in lockstep with President Donald Trump, the GOP will retain control of the Senate for at least the next two years.\nWhile Democrats have performed well in early voting, both sides are watching election day turnout in the state\u2019s conservative congressional districts.\nAnd as Trump faces criticism for his attempts to pressure Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state to \u201dfind\u201d votes to overturn Biden\u2019s victory, officials in both parties in Georgia and Washington are bracing for another lengthy and acrimonious vote-counting process.\nIn a sign of the importance of the dual Senate races, Biden, Harris, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have traveled to Georgia in the days leading up to the election to rally supporters and activate their respective bases.\n\u00a9 Alexander Drago/Reuters Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Sen. David Perdue wave during a campaign event at the Olde Blind Dog Irish Pub, in Milton, Ga., Dec. 21, 2020.\n\u201dIt's a biggie. Our country is depending on you. The whole world is watching the people of Georgia,\u201d Trump said of the contests as he stumped for Loeffler and Perdue on the eve of the runoffs in Dalton, which sits in the northwest portion of the state near the border of Tennessee.\n\u201dGeorgia, the whole nation is looking to you to lead us forward,\u201d Biden said at a drive-in rally on Monday, during his second trip to Atlanta to campaign alongside Warnock and Ossoff. \u201dThe power is literally in your hands unlike any time in my career -- one state. One state can chart the course, not just for the next four years, but for the next generation.\u201d\nHistory remains on the GOP's side since runoffs in the state have historically favored Republicans. Even more than a quarter century ago, when former President Bill Clinton captured Georgia's electoral votes, Democratic Sen. Wyche Fowler led in the general election but ultimately lost to Republican Paul Coverdell in the overtime rematch.\n\u201dRepublicans are going to make sure that they show up,\u201d said Jay Williams, a Republican consultant in Georgia. \u201dThey're not going to cut off their noses to spite their face.\u201d\nBut some Democrats in the state believe Trump\u2019s extraordinary attempts to subvert the democratic process are deterring the GOP's base from showing up for a second time.\n\u201dThere\u2019s a schism in the Republican Party that has to be dispiriting to Republicans, for those who have not voted yet, I\u2019m sure these current events, like the president\u2019s newly released taped phone call, will have some bearing on their vote (Tuesday),\u201d said Rep. Hank Johnson, who represents the suburbs east of Atlanta.\nJohnson added that for Democrats to succeed on Tuesday, robust turnout is central to their effort to match Biden's victory.\n\u201dDemocrats are looking at the fact that we have the nation\u2019s future in our hands. All we have to do is turn out,\u201d he continued. \u201dGeorgia Democrats are looking at this election not just for the salvation of the state of Georgia, but what it means for the country.\u201d\nThis report was featured in the Tuesday, Jan. 5, 2020, episode of \u201cStart Here,\u201d ABC News\u2019 daily news podcast.\n\u201dStart Here\u201d offers a straightforward look at the day's top stories in 20 minutes.

            "As Georgians choose their two U.S. Senators in the January 5th runoff elections, the stakes could not be greater.\nIf Democratic challengers Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff defeat incumbent Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, the result will be 50-50 deadlock between the parties.\nIf Congress certifies Joe Biden\u2019s Electoral College advantage on January 6, a day after the runoff, it will deliver the Senate into Democratic hands.\nBecause the vice president serves as the Senate\u2019s president and can vote to break any deadlock, a Biden presidency means that Vice President Kamala Harris could cast the tie-breaking vote on any Senate matter.\nSEN. DAVID PERDUE: GEORGIANS SHOULD VOTE FOR ME & SEN. LOEFFLER TO STOP DEMS\u2019 RADICAL SOCIALIST AGENDA\n\nGiven that the Democrats continue to control the U.S. House of Representatives, a GOP loss of the Senate would put them in charge of Congress.\nThat would not only be catastrophic for Republicans, it would be a colossal mistake for the country and would contradict the will of most of the electorate including independents and many Democrats.\n\nThe reason is two-fold.\nFirst, today\u2019s national Democratic party has drastically changed from what it once was. It has moved from being a center-left party during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency to one that is increasingly driven by far-left ideas and policies.\nSecond, rather than going against the tide, Warnock and Ossoff are part of it in major ways.\n\nThe older Democratic party focused on equality of opportunity, economic growth and targeted tax cuts. Today\u2019s party demands equality of outcome and redistribution of wealth.\nJON OSSOFF: GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS \u2013 HERE'S MY MESSAGE FOR PEACH STATE REPUBLICANS\nThe Clinton Democrats supported hiring more police officers. Today\u2019s Democratic leaders, at least at the state and local level, are open to \u201ddefunding\u201d entire police departments.\nDemocrats during the days of centrist Georgia senator Sam Nunn focused on a strong United States military. Today, they are far more hostile to the Pentagon.\nDemocrats once saw America as a force for good in the world. Now many of them see America as an ugly, imperialist country of oppression.\nLate 20th century Democrats believed in making our energy sources cleaner through science and technology. Today they seek to ban every form of energy except for renewables.\nSEN. THOM TILLIS: GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS \u2013 SEND PERDUE, LOEFFLER BACK TO DC, SEND PELOSI, SCHUMER A MESSAGE\nYesterday\u2019s party didn't dismiss public school choice. Now it opposes alternatives for children from impoverished families trapped in failing neighborhood schools.\n\nOn every one of these issues, not just Republicans and independents, but millions of Democratic voters prefer the older version of the party. That is partly why Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. has failed twice to become the Democratic nominee for president.\n\nAnd on all or most of these issues, Warnock and Ossoff prefer today\u2019s radicalized party.\n\nAs the pastor currently in a leadership role at Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Warnock represents as well as anyone the radical shift that has occurred.\nThroughout his life, Dr. King embraced the mainstream liberal view that America needed to be reformed so it could live up to its own ideals as expressed in the Declaration of Independence.\nWarnock, on the other hand, seems to embrace the illiberal Marxist idea of America as fundamentally flawed from its inception, and as needing to reject and disown its supposedly wicked foundation.\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO: GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS -- THE FATE OF OUR NATION IS IN GEORGIA'S HANDS\nHis sermons over the years have included expressions of sympathy for Cuba's late Marxist leader Fidel Castro and condemnation for Christians serving in the armed forces.\nHe has met with the Nation of Islam's Louis Farrakhan and defended controversial pastor Rev. Jeremiah Wright while failing to condemn his incendiary comments.\nHe has implied that Israel acts like an apartheid state, thus resurrecting from its shallow grave the old Soviet-led U.N. resolution equating Zionism with racism.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAs for Ossoff, he, like Warnock, is drawn to the Sanders-Ocasio-Cortez wing of his party, boasting about receiving Sanders\u2019 endorsement and mimicking their views on issues ranging from the environment to gun control to health care. In addition, his ties to China and its ruling Communist party are concerning.\n\nTellingly, both Warnock and Ossoff have raised millions of out-of-state dollars from San Francisco and Silicon Valley area donors.\nThis points to a major reason for the Democrats\u2019 radicalization -- their increasing dependence on precisely those kinds of contributors who often espouse hard left beliefs.\nPrior to their rise, Democrats raised most of their money from more centrist donors who had a moderating influence on the party.\n\nIn short, a victory for both candidates in Georgia on Tuesday would drag not just the Democrats but the nation far from centrist values and policies.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIn its founding ideals, as well as its current reality, America would be placed in jeopardy.\n\nLet the people of Georgia pay heed.\n"

Democratic challenger Raphael Warnock beat Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler, TV networks and Edison Research projected. Democrat Jon Ossoff held a narrow lead over Republican David Perdue in the other race, with a final outcome not expected until later on Wednesday. With 98% reporting, Warnock was ahead of Loeffler by 1.2 percentage points, roughly 50,000 votes, while Ossoff led Perdue by more than 12,000 votes, according to Edison Research. Democrats must win both contests to take control of the Senate. A Democratic sweep would create a 50-50 split in the Senate and give Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, as president of the Senate, the tie-breaking vote after she and Biden take office on Jan. 20. The party already has a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. If Republicans hold the second seat, they will effectively wield veto power over Biden\u2019s political and judicial appointees as well as many of his legislative initiatives in areas such as economic relief from the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, healthcare and criminal justice. Most of the votes remaining to be counted were in counties Biden won in November, with roughly 13,000 votes still to be counted in Democratic-leaning DeKalb County near Atlanta, according to Edison Research estimates, fueling Democratic optimism about an astounding Georgia sweep.

The critical races drew an estimated 4.5 million voters - a record for a runoff - along with nearly half a billion dollars in advertising spending since Nov. 3 and visits on Monday by Republican President Donald Trump and Biden. Even if they manage to secure a slim Senate majority, Biden and Democrats could find it difficult to advance some legislative priorities in the Senate, where most bills need to clear a 60-vote procedural threshold in the 100-seat chamber. The head-to-head runoff elections in Georgia, a quirk of state law, became necessary when no candidate in either race drew more than 50% of the vote in November\u2019s general election. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said election officials would take a break overnight but resume counting on Wednesday morning. \u201cHopefully by noon we\u2019ll have a better idea where we are,\u201d he said on CNN.

On Saturday, Trump pressured Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, on a phone call to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to reverse Biden\u2019s victory, falsely claiming massive fraud. Trump\u2019s bid to undo his loss - with some Republicans planning to object to the certification of Biden\u2019s win when Congress meets on Wednesday to formally count the presidential vote - have split his party and drawn condemnation from critics who accuse him of undermining democracy.

        "summarized_context": "The outcome of the Senate runoff elections in Georgia will determine control of the Senate and the fate of President-elect Joe Biden's agenda. Democrats Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock need to win both races in order to flip the Senate and hold a 50-50 majority, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaking vote. The races are highly competitive, with both parties campaigning heavily. If the Democrats win, it would give them control of Congress and potentially lead to a shift towards more progressive policies. Republicans are hoping to maintain control of the Senate to counterbalance the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives."

About 7 in 10 agreed with his false assertion that Biden was not the legitimately elected president, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 3,600 voters in the runoff elections.\nElection officials across the country, including the Republican governors in Arizona and Georgia, as well as Trump\u2019s former attorney general, William Barr, have confirmed that there was no widespread fraud in the November election. Nearly all the legal challenges from Trump and his allies have been dismissed by judges, including two tossed by the Supreme Court, where three Trump-nominated justices preside.\nEven with Trump\u2019s claims, voters in both parties were drawn to the polls because of the high stakes. AP VoteCast found that 6 in 10 Georgia voters say Senate party control was the most important factor in their vote.\nEven before Tuesday, Georgia had shattered its turnout record for a runoff with more than 3 million votes by mail or during in-person advance voting in December. Including Tuesday\u2019s vote, more people ultimately cast ballots in the runoffs than voted in Georgia\u2019s 2016 presidential election.\nIn Atlanta\u2019s Buckhead neighborhood, 37-year-old Kari Callaghan said she voted \u201call Democrat\u201d on Tuesday, an experience that was new for her.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been Republican, but I\u2019ve been pretty disgusted by Trump and just the way the Republicans are working,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like for the Republican candidates to still stand there with Trump and campaign with Trump feels pretty rotten. This isn\u2019t the conservative values that I grew up with.\u201d\nBut 56-year-old Will James said he voted \u201cstraight GOP.\u201d\nHe said he was concerned by the Republican candidates\u2019 recent support of Trump\u2019s challenges of the presidential election results in Georgia, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t really change the reasons I voted.\u201d\n\u201cI believe in balance of power, and I don\u2019t want either party to have a referendum, basically,\u201d he said.\n___\nPeoples reported from New York.

        "context": "ATLANTA (Reuters) -Democrats on Wednesday completed a sweep of the two U.S. Senate seats up for grabs in runoff elections in the state of Georgia, giving the party control of the chamber and boosting the prospects for President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s ambitious legislative agenda. Raphael Warnock, a Baptist preacher from Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s former church, beat Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler to become the first Black senator in the deep South state\u2019s history while Democrat Jon Ossoff, a documentary filmaker who at 33 would become the Senate\u2019s youngest member, beat Republican David Perdue. The results would give Democrats narrow control of both chambers of Congress, making it easier to appoint liberal-leaning judges and advance legislative priorities from coronavirus relief to climate change when Biden takes office on Jan. 20. \u201cGeorgia\u2019s voters delivered a resounding message yesterday: they want action on the crises we face and they want it right now,\u201d Biden said in a statement. He said he would work with both parties to confirm key administration officials quickly. The Georgia result is a final repudiation of outgoing President Donald Trump, who stands to be the first U.S. president since 1932 to lose the White House and both chambers of Congress in a single term. Trump held rallies for both Republican candidates, but overshadowed the campaign with false accusations that his own loss in the November presidential election in Georgia was tainted by fraud, repeatedly attacking Republican officials in the state. Hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Wednesday in an attempt to force Congress to undo Trump\u2019s election loss. With 98% of the vote counted, Warnock led Loeffler by 1.5 percentage points and Ossoff led Perdue by 0.6 percentage points, according to Edison Research. Both are expected to win beyond the margin that would require a recount. Winning both contests would hand Democrats narrow control of the Senate by creating a 50-50 split and giving Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote from Jan. 20. The party already has a thin majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Republicans would retain control of the Senate if they held on to at least one of the Georgia seats. Slideshow ( 4 images ) The campaign\u2019s final days were overshadowed by Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Republican Georgia officials to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to overturn Biden\u2019s win in the state, as well as his unfounded fraud accusations. He has yet to admit defeat. \u201cWe will never give up, we will never concede,\u201d Trump told thousands of supporters at a rally. \u2018NOT A GREAT WAY TO TURN OUT YOUR VOTERS\u2019 Some Republicans blamed Trump for the loss. \u201cIt turns out that telling the voters that the election is rigged is not a great way to turn out your voters,\u201d Senator Mitt Romney, one of Trump\u2019s few Republican critics in Congress, told reporters. The election signaled a shift in the politics of Georgia and the wider deep South. At least 4.5 million voters participated, smashing earlier turnout figures for runoff races. Democrats have worked hard to increase turnout among Black voters, their most reliable supporters in the region. More than 129,000 voters in the runoffs did not vote in November, according to state data. Most of them were Democrats, Gabriel Sterling, a Republican state election official, told a news conference: \u201cWhile Republicans were busy attacking the governor and my boss, Democrats were knocking on doors and getting out the vote.\u201d Slideshow ( 4 images ) In a video message, Warnock, whose Ebenezer Baptist Church is legendary in Georgia because of its role in the civil rights movement under King, recalled his humble upbringing as one of 12 children of a woman who worked in cotton fields. \u201cBecause this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else\u2019s cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,\u201d he said. Declaring victory, Ossoff said he looked forward \u201cto serving you in the United States Senate with integrity, with humility, with honor\u201d. Both Republican senators, following Trump\u2019s lead, vowed to fight on. \u201cWe will mobilize every available resource and exhaust every legal recourse to ensure all legally cast ballots are counted,\u201d Perdue said in a statement. During the campaign, Republicans had painted Ossoff and Warnock as radicals who would pursue a hard-left agenda. That message failed to resonate with many white suburbanites who have increasingly abandoned the Republican party under Trump. Trump pressed Vice President Mike Pence to throw out election results in states he narrowly lost when he presides over the counting of electoral votes to certify Biden\u2019s victory. Pence has no authority to do so. The joint session of Congress was disrupted by Trump supporters and it is unclear when it will be completed. Some Republican lawmakers have said they will try to reject some state tallies, which could drag out the certification process but stands no chance of succeeding.",
        "summarized_context": "Democrat Raphael Warnock has won one of Georgia's two Senate runoffs, making history as the state's first Black senator and bringing the Senate majority within reach for the Democratic Party. Warnock defeated Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler, dealing a blow to outgoing President Donald Trump. The focus now shifts to the second runoff between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican David Perdue, which is still too close to call. If Ossoff wins, Democrats will have control of Congress, bolstering President-elect Joe Biden's position. Warnock's victory reflects a shift in Georgia's politics and follows Biden's win in the state in November."

            "(CNN) Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley's announcement Wednesday that he will formally object to the Electoral College results will trigger an existential choice -- in the form of a vote on the House and Senate floors -- for Republicans: Do you stand with President Donald Trump's wild falsehoods about the 2020 election or do you take the side of facts?\n\u201dI cannot vote to certify the Electoral College results on January 6 without raising the fact that some states, particularly Pennsylvania, failed to follow their own state election laws,\u201d Hawley said in announcing his decision. \u201dAt the very least, Congress should investigate allegations of voter fraud and adopt measures to secure the integrity of our elections. But Congress has so far failed to act.\u201d\nHawley is the first senator to formally object to the results, in which President-elect Joe Biden defeated Trump with 306 electoral votes to 232. Hawley joins Rep. Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican, in his plans to object, which means that there will be a formal debate in both chambers about the debunked claims made by Trump and his allies regarding widespread voter irregularities and fraud in the election. And then, following that debate, there will be a vote.\nThis is a disaster for Republican leaders on both sides of the Capitol.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has been desperately trying to defuse the rhetorical bombs being thrown by Trump on his way out of office -- the latest being the President's demand that $600 stimulus checks be increased to $2,000 -- in hopes of protecting his vulnerable incumbents up in 2022 from difficult votes that could come back to haunt them in a primary or a general election.",

Josh Hawley said he will object to the Electoral College certification during a joint session of Congress scheduled for Jan. 6, giving House Republicans the senator they need to put into action their long shot to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory.\nThe announcement, shared to social media Wednesday morning, is sure to give President Trump a boost as he refuses to concede the race two months after Election Day over claims of election fraud.\n\u201dI will follow the same practice Democrat members of Congress have in years past and object during the certification process on January 6 to raise these critical issues,\u201d Hawley said.\nThe senator from Missouri also said that he'd object to the certification because \u201dsome states, particularly Pennsylvania, failed to follow their own state election laws\u201d and because of \u201dthe unprecedented effort of mega corporations, including Facebook and Twitter to interfere in this election, in support of Joe Biden.\u201d\n\u201dAt the very least, Congress should investigate allegations of voter fraud and adopt measures to secure the integrity of our elections,\u201d he stated, even though federal and state officials have repeatedly said they have not seen evidence of fraud to the level necessary to influence the outcome of the election. \u201dBut Congress has so far failed to act.\u201d\nDuring that joint congressional meeting, Congress is meeting to certify Biden\u2019s presidency. Under the rules of the Electoral Count Act, passed in 1887, should a member of both chambers object in writing to each slate of electors, then both the Senate and House will hold a two-hour debate, and they will then vote to accept or reject the challenged electoral college votes, Politico reported.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has urged his caucus not to support the challenge.\n\u201cMany millions of us had hoped the presidential election would yield a different result, but our system of government has processes to determine who will be sworn in on Jan. 20,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor. \u201cThe Electoral College has spoken.\u201d\nAlabama Rep. Mo Brooks was the first Republican to announce his intentions to challenge the certification. Reps. Jody Hice of Georgia, Jim Jordan of Ohio, and Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia have also been reportedly tied to the effort.\n\u201dDemocrats in Congress objected during the certification of electoral votes in order to raise concerns about election integrity,\u201d Hawley said. \u201dThey were praised by Democratic leadership and the media when they did. And they were entitled to do so. But now those of us concerned about the integrity of this election are entitled to do the same.\u201d\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this story asserted that no Democratic senator had supported prior Electoral College objections, but this is incorrect.

Josh Hawley of Missouri announced on Wednesday that he plans to object during Congress\u2019 meeting to certify Electoral College votes next week in order to highlight unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud and the role of \u201cBig Tech monopolies\u201c in the election.",

            "Though Hawley's challenge will have no bearing on the ultimate outcome of the election \u2014 numerous GOP senators have accepted Biden as president-elect \u2014 it will delay the certification of Biden's victory and force every member of the House and Senate on the record affirming Biden's win.",

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., says he will raise objections next week when the Congress meets to affirm President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the election, forcing House and Senate votes that are likely to delay \u2014 but in no way alter \u2014 the final certification of Biden\u2019s win.",
            "Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley vowed Wednesday to challenge the results of the 2020 election when lawmakers convene for a joint session to count the Electoral College votes next week, becoming the first Republican senator to join an ultimately futile last effort to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory.",
            "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other GOP brass in the upper chamber warned their members earlier this month against joining House Republicans in challenging Biden\u2019s victory because the effort could result in a heavy political price even though it ultimately can\u2019t succeed.",
            "Hawley is a first-term senator and potential contender in the 2024 presidential primary, and his decision to join the House objectors is a rebuff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had asked his caucus not to participate in a futile quest to overturn the results.",

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., announced Wednesday that he would object to the certification of some states' Electoral College results on Jan. 6, a move that will force his fellow Republicans to vote to choose between rejecting President Donald Trump's unsubstantiated claims of massive voter fraud in this year's election or disenfranchising millions of voters.",
            "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had privately urged Republican senators not to challenge the vote because it could put some vulnerable Republicans at odds with fervent Trump supporters.",
            "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., announced Wednesday that he intends to lodge an official objection to the electoral vote count in Congress next week, an event that under normal circumstances would be a routine ceremony to finalize President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election.",
            "Since multiple House Republicans, led by Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, have already said they will raise similar objections, Hawley's move is likely to delay final certification of the election results by at least several hours.",
            "In a last-ditch effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, and against the warnings of Senate Republican leaders, Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley announced Wednesday that he plans to object during the Electoral College certification process in Congress on Jan. 6.",

            "Meanwhile, several House Republicans praised Hawley for his announcement, a move that comes as Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks, who says he will contest the Electoral College votes in January, told Fox News' Fox & Friends this week that \u201cdozens\u201c of GOP representatives may be on board in objecting to the election results.",

        "context": "(Reuters) - Republican Senator Josh Hawley on Wednesday pledged to challenge Democrat President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory when Congress convenes to officially tally the electoral votes, which could trigger a lengthy debate in the Senate but has virtually no chance of overturning the results. Hawley, the junior senator from Missouri who was elected in 2018, said in a statement, that \u201csome states, particularly Pennsylvania, failed to follow their own state election laws.\u201d \u201cAt the very least, Congress should investigate,\u201d he said in a statement. Hawley did not provide any evidence for his claims. A number of Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives have said they plan to object to the election results, but Hawley is the first U.S. senator to do so. Biden beat President Donald Trump by a 306-232 margin in the Electoral College. Trump has refused to concede defeat and has repeatedly falsely claimed the election was tainted by widespread fraud. Under the Electoral College system, \u201celectoral votes\u201d are allotted to states and the District of Columbia based on their congressional representation. Congress is due to make the Electoral College tally official on Jan. 6 in what is largely a ceremonial session. \u201cYou just get some theater with your ceremony this time,\u201d said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles and a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. Hawley\u2019s objection could trigger hours of debate and would force a vote over the objection, Levitt said. That could put some Republicans in the uncomfortable position of rejecting Trump\u2019s claims of fraud. Despite Hawley\u2019s challenge, senior Republican senators have said Biden\u2019s victory will stand in the Republican-controlled Senate. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Senate\u2019s top Republican, acknowledged Biden\u2019s victory on Dec. 15 and has urged other Senate Republicans to refrain from objecting on Jan. 6.",
        "summarized_context": "Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley has announced that he will object to the Electoral College results during the joint session of Congress on January 6. This move aligns him with President Donald Trump's baseless claims of election fraud. Hawley's objection will trigger a formal debate and vote in both chambers. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has urged his caucus not to support the challenge. Hawley's decision puts Republican leaders in a difficult position, as they try to navigate Trump's demands and protect vulnerable incumbents. This move is seen as a long shot attempt to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory."

            "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Tuesday punted on a House-passed bill to increase coronavirus relief payments to $2,000 despite mounting bipartisan support for the checks, including from President Donald Trump.\nMcConnell acknowledged that Trump, as he signed the most recent COVID-19 relief package on Sunday, also asked for action on three areas of his concern, including the stimulus payments. The other issues on Trump\u2019s wish list are intensified election security and lesser liability protections for social media companies.\nThe Democratic-controlled House on Monday passed a bill to more than triple the relief payments from the $600 in the bill that Trump signed to $2,000, with dozens of Republicans voting in favor. The Senate\u2019s Democratic leadership is pressing McConnell to bring the measure calling for $2,000 payments to a vote in the upper chamber, but the majority leader has so far refused to commit to that.\nMcConnell on Tuesday offered a vague preview of his legislative plan as the current congressional session draws to a close shortly into the new year. \u201cThis week, the Senate will begin a process\u201d to bring the three issues raised by Trump \u201cinto focus,\u201d he said from the Senate floor.\nMoments later, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) sought unanimous consent for the Senate to take up the $2,000 payments bill.\nThe heftier checks \u201ccould mean the difference between American families having groceries for a few extra weeks or going hungry,\u201d Schumer said in a floor speech. He then asked, \u201cWill Senate Republicans fight for a vote on the House-passed [bill] or will they look some other way?\u201d\nMcConnell swiftly blocked Schumer\u2019s request.\nSen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer: \u201dWill Senate Republicans stand against the House of Representatives, the Democratic majority in the Senate, and the president of their own party, to prevent these $2,000 checks from going out the door?\u201d pic.twitter.com/Dj7CAWb2WQ \u2014 The Recount (@therecount) December 29, 2020\nAfter a monthslong impasse, Congress last week finally passed a $900 billion COVID-19 relief package. But Trump, whose administration helped negotiate the bill, stunned Republicans when he urged lawmakers to increase the $600 payments outlined in the legislation. For a few days he left the impression he might veto the bill, before ultimately signing it while noting his objections.\nSome Democrats, along with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), have been pushing for $2,000 stimulus checks for months. They are now offering their full-throated support for Trump\u2019s call for the higher payments.\nAt least five Senate Republicans \u2015 including Marco Rubio of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina \u2015 have said they would vote in favor of the heftier checks. GOP Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue of Georgia announced their support for the payments on Tuesday, a week ahead of the pivotal runoff races in their state that will determine which party controls the Senate in the next congressional session.\nMcConnell signaled Tuesday that the $2,000 payments could be negotiated as part of a deal tackling the two other issues Trump wants addressed. It\u2019s unclear, however, when such negotiations would take place.\nSanders on Monday said he would filibuster a Senate vote to override Trump\u2019s veto of the National Defense Authorization Act, scheduled for Wednesday, to pressure McConnell to bring the $2,000 payments bill to a vote. On Tuesday, Sanders called for McConnell to hold a vote on the $2,000 checks bill immediately after Wednesday\u2019s scheduled NDAA veto override vote, but the Republican leader rejected the request.\n\u201cWorking families need help now \u2015 not next year \u2015 but right now,\u201d Sanders said in Senate floor remarks. \u201cNow it is time for the Senate to step up to the plate and do what the working families of this country overwhelmingly want us to do.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cHunger in America is at the highest level that it has been for decades, with moms and dads struggling to feed their kids and working families lining up mile after mile to get emergency food packages. ... All of this taking place in the wealthiest country in the history of the world.\u201d\nThere it is. McConnell blocks motion to vote on Democrats' $2,000 relief checks bill. pic.twitter.com/iYceWbNxiU \u2014 Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) December 29, 2020\nIn a series of tweets Tuesday, Trump attacked Republican leadership for dragging their feet on the increased stimulus checks bill.\n\u201cUnless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2000 payments ASAP. $600 IS NOT ENOUGH!\u201d Trump wrote. He then accused \u201cBig Tech\u201d of \u201cstealing\u201d the country and falsely claimed that Democrats stole the presidential election.\nImportant conversations are happening now.

            "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that the Senate will address President Trump's request to increase stimulus checks sent to Americans to $2,000, but did not commit to pushing the issue as he blocked attempts by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to put the House bill on $2,000 stimulus checks up for quick consideration.\nThat led Trump to launch a Twitter broadside against Senate Republicans, warning them that if they don't have a \u201ddeath wish\u201d they'll back the boosted checks.\nSchumer's request would have passed the stimulus checks Tuesday afternoon. Sanders' request would have set a vote on the bill for stimulus checks Wednesday afternoon.\nSpeaking on the Senate floor, McConnell acknowledged that Trump \u201dwould like further direct financial support for American households.\u201d He also mentioned that Trump wants Congress to address Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provides protections for companies that host third-party content on their platforms -- like Facebook and Twitter -- and that Trump wants Congress to look into election security.\n130 HOUSE REPUBLICANS, 2 DEMOCRATS VOTE AGAINST $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS\n\u201dThose are the three important subjects the president has linked together,\u201d McConnell said. \u201dThis week the Senate will begin a process to bring these three priorities into focus.\u201d\nNotably, McConnell did not promise action on the $2,000 stimulus checks. Whether the Senate even gets to a cloture vote -- a vote to end debate and proceed to a final vote -- on the stimulus checks will be up to McConnell. He controls Senate floor action.\nIf Trump gets his way, McConnell will bring the checks up for a vote.\n\u201dUnless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2000 payments ASAP,\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday. \u201d$600 IS NOT ENOUGH! Also, get rid of Section 230 - Don\u2019t let Big Tech steal our Country, and don\u2019t let the Democrats steal the Presidential Election. Get tough!\u201d\nSanders then objected to McConnell's attempt to quickly move to a vote to override Trump's veto of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).\nSTIMULUS CHECKS ROUND 2: WHAT TO EXPECT\n\u201dThere are only a few days left in this session,\u201d Schumer said, urging the Senate to prioritize relief checks. \u201dWe should not adjourn until the Senate holds a vote on both measures: the NDAA veto override and the House bill to provide $2,000 checks for the American people.\u201d\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, Sens. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga.; David Perdue, R-Ga.; Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Josh Hawley, R-Mo.; and Marco Rubio, R.-Fla., have backed the House legislation for $2,000 stimulus checks, which passed with more than a two-thirds majority Monday.\nSeven more Senate Republicans would need to come out in support of the checks in order to break a filibuster on a cloture vote and set the issue for an up-or-down vote.\nSanders' objection to McConnell's attempt to quickly consider the NDAA veto led McConnell to schedule a vote on a motion to proceed on the veto override for Wednesday afternoon. McConnell could file cloture to end debate on the override Wednesday night, which would allow the Senate to take up that cloture vote on Jan. 1.\nThis tees up a potential vote on the actual veto override for Saturday, Jan. 2.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThat puts Congress on a tight timeline on both the veto override and the stimulus checks. The current Congress must adjourn by Jan. 3.\nFox News' Jason Donner contributed to this report."

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Followed by a staffer, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., right, leaves the Capitol for the day, Tuesday, Dec. 29, 2020, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s push for bigger $2,000 COVID-19 relief checks stalled out Tuesday in the Senate as Republicans blocked a swift vote proposed by Democrats and split within their own ranks over whether to boost spending or defy the White House. The roadblock mounted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may not be sustainable as pressure mounts. Trump wants the Republican-led chamber to follow the House and increase the checks from $600 for millions of Americans. A growing number of Republicans, including two senators in runoff elections on Jan. 5 in Georgia, have said they will support the larger amount. But most GOP senators oppose more spending, even if they are also wary of bucking Trump. Senators will be back at it Wednesday as McConnell is devising a way out of the political bind, but the outcome is highly uncertain. \u201cThere\u2019s one question left today: Do Senate Republicans join with the rest of America in supporting $2,000 checks?\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said as he made a motion to vote. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said some of the $600 payments might be sent by direct deposit to Americans\u2019 bank accounts as early as Tuesday night. Mnuchin tweeted that paper checks will begin to go out Wednesday. The showdown over the $2,000 checks has thrown Congress into a chaotic year-end session just days before new lawmakers are set to be sworn into office for the new year. It\u2019s preventing action on another priority \u2014 overturning Trump\u2019s veto on a sweeping defense bill that has been approved every year for 60 years. Saying little, McConnell signaled an alternative approach to Trump\u2019s checks that may not divide his party so badly, but may result in no action at all. The GOP leader filed new legislation late Tuesday linking the president\u2019s demand for bigger checks with two other Trump priorities \u2014 repealing protections for tech companies like Facebook or Twitter that the president complained are unfair to conservatives as well the establishment of a bipartisan commission to review the 2020 presidential election he lost to President-elect Joe Biden . \u201cThe Senate will begin a process,\u201d the GOP leader said. He said little more, only that he would bring the president\u2019s demand for the $2,000 checks and other remaining issues \u201cinto focus.\u201d The president\u2019s last-minute push for bigger checks leaves Republicans deeply split between those who align with Trump\u2019s populist instincts and those who adhere to what had been more traditional conservative views against government spending. Congress had settled on smaller $600 payments in a compromise over the big, year-end relief bill Trump reluctantly signed into law. Liberal senators led by Bernie Sanders of Vermont who support the relief aid are blocking action on the defense bill until a vote can be taken on Trump\u2019s demand for $2,000 for most Americans. \u201cThe working class of this country today faces more economic desperation than at any time since the Great Depression of the 1930s,\u201d Sanders said as he also tried to force a vote on the relief checks. \u201cWorking families need help now.\u201d But McConnell objected a second time. The GOP blockade is causing turmoil for some as the virus crisis worsens nationwide and Trump amplifies his unexpected demands. The two GOP senators from Georgia, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, announced Tuesday they support Trump\u2019s plan for bigger checks as they face Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in runoff elections that will determine which party controls the Senate. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to support the president,\u201d said Perdue on Fox News. Loeffler said in an interview on Fox that she, too, backs the boosted relief checks. ADVERTISEMENT Trump repeated his demand in a tweet ahead of Tuesday\u2019s Senate session: \u201d$2000 for our great people, not $600!\u201d Following Trump\u2019s lead, Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Marco Rubio of Florida, among the party\u2019s potential 2024 presidential hopefuls, are pushing the party in the president\u2019s direction. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the votes. Let\u2019s vote today,\u201d Hawley tweeted. Other Republicans panned the bigger checks saying the nearly $400 billion price tag was too high, the relief is not targeted to those in need and Washington has already dispatched ample sums on COVID aid. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent $4 trillion on this problem,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. The House vote late Monday to approve Trump\u2019s request was a stunning turn of events. Just days ago, during a brief Christmas Eve session, Republicans blocked Trump\u2019s sudden demand for bigger checks as he defiantly refused to sign the broader COVID-19 aid and year-end funding bill into law. As Trump spent days fuming from his private club in Florida, where he is spending the holidays, millions of Americans saw jobless aid lapse and the nation risked a federal government shutdown Tuesday. Dozens of Republicans calculated it was better to link with Democrats to increase the pandemic payments rather than buck the outgoing president and constituents counting on the money. House Democrats led passage, 275-134, but 44 Republicans joined almost all Democrats for a robust two-thirds vote of approval. It\u2019s highly possible that McConnell will set up votes ahead on both the House-passed measure supporting Trump\u2019s $2,000 checks as well as his own new version linking it with the repeal of tech company liability shield in \u201csection 230\u201d of communications law as well as the new presidential election review commission. That\u2019s a process that almost ensures neither bill will pass. Trump\u2019s push could fizzle out in the Senate but the debate over the size and scope of the package \u2014 $900 billion in COVID-19 aid and $1.4 trillion to fund government agencies \u2014 is potentially one last confrontation before the new Congress is sworn in Sunday. For now, the $600 checks are set to be delivered, along with other aid, among the largest rescue packages of its kind. The COVID-19 portion of the bill revives a weekly pandemic jobless benefit boost \u2014 this time $300, through March 14 \u2014 as well as the popular Paycheck Protection Program of grants to businesses to keep workers on payrolls. It extends eviction protections, adding a new rental assistance fund. Americans earning up to $75,000 will qualify for the direct $600 payments, which are phased out at higher income levels, and there\u2019s an additional $600 payment per dependent child. Biden supports the $2,000 checks and said Tuesday the aid package is merely a \u201cdown payment\u201d on what he plans to deliver once in office. Economists said a $600 check will help, but that it\u2019s a far cry from the spending power that a $2,000 check would provide for the economy. \u201cIt will make a big difference whether it\u2019s $600 versus $2,000,\u201d said Ryan Sweet, an economist with Moody\u2019s. The president also objected to foreign aid funding that his own administration had requested and vowed to send Congress \u201ca redlined version\u201d with spending items he wants removed. But those are merely suggestions to Congress. Democrats said they would resist such cuts. ___ Colvin reported from West Palm Beach, Florida. Associated Press writers Bill Barrow in Atlanta, Ashraf Khalil in Washington and Matt Ott in Silver Spring, Maryland, contributed to this report.",
        "summarized_context": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to commit to a vote on a House-passed bill to increase coronavirus relief payments to $2,000, despite bipartisan support. McConnell stated that the Senate would address President Trump's request for increased stimulus checks, along with his concerns about election security and social media liability protections. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sought unanimous consent for the Senate to take up the bill, but McConnell blocked the request. At least five Senate Republicans have expressed support for the larger payments. McConnell suggested that negotiations on the $2,000 payments could be part of a deal addressing the other issues raised by Trump."

Republican President Donald Trump, who has spent much of his term in office defending Russia from various allegations of hacking and interference, downplayed the breach and raised the possibility that China might be involved.\nAttorney General Bill Barr on Monday became the latest Trump loyalist to break with the outgoing president on the issue, telling a news conference that he agreed with Pompeo's assessment: \u201dIt certainly appears to be the Russians but I am not going to discuss it beyond that.\u201d\n(Reporting by Raphael Satter; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Sonya Hepinstall)",

            "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Congress has overridden President Donald Trump\u2019s veto of a defense policy bill, a first by lawmakers since he took office nearly four years ago.\nIn an extraordinary New Year\u2019s Day session, the Republican-controlled Senate easily turned aside the veto, dismissing Trump\u2019s objections to the $740 billion bill and handing him a stinging rebuke just weeks before his term ends.\nTrump had lashed out at GOP lawmakers on Twitter, charging earlier this week that \u201cWeak and tired Republican \u2018leadership\u2019 will allow the bad Defense Bill to pass.\u2033\nTrump called the looming override vote a \u201cdisgraceful act of cowardice and total submission by weak people to Big Tech. Negotiate a better Bill, or get better leaders, NOW!\u201d\nThe 81-13 vote in the Senate followed an earlier 322-87 override vote in the House of the widely popular defense measure. The bill provides a 3% pay raise for U.S. troops and guides defense policy, cementing decisions about troop levels, new weapons systems and military readiness, personnel policy and other military goals. Many programs, including military construction, can only go into effect if the bill is approved.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said before the vote that Congress has passed the National Defense Authorization Act every year for 59 years in a row, \u201cand one way or another, we are going to complete the 60th annual NDAA and pass it into law before this Congress concludes on Sunday.\u2033\nThe bill \u201clooks after our brave men and women who volunteer to wear the uniform,\u2033 McConnell said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a tremendous opportunity: to direct our national security priorities to reflect the resolve of the American people and the evolving threats to their safety, at home and abroad. It\u2019s our chance to ensure we keep pace with competitors like Russia and China.\u2033\u2063\nThe Senate override was delayed after Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., objected to moving ahead until McConnell allowed a vote on a Trump-backed plan to increase COVID-19 relief payments to $2,000. McConnel did not allow that vote; instead he used his parliamentary power to set a vote limiting debate on the defense measure, overcoming a filibuster threat by Sanders and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.\nWithout a bipartisan agreement, a vote on the bill could have been delayed until Saturday night. Lawmakers, however, agreed to an immediate roll call Friday once the filibuster threat was stopped.\nTrump rejected the defense measure last week, saying it failed to limit social media companies he claimed were biased against him during his failed reelection campaign. Trump also opposed language that allows for the renaming of military bases that honor Confederate leaders.\nSen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with Trump\u2019s veto and called the bill \u201cabsolutely vital to our national security and our troops.\u2033\n\u201cThis is the most important bill we have,\u2033 Inhofe said. \u201cIt puts members of the military first.\u2033\nTrump has succeeded throughout his four-year term in enforcing party discipline in Congress, with few Republicans willing to publicly oppose him. The bipartisan overrides on the defense bill showed the limits of Trump\u2019s influence in the final weeks of his term.\nEarlier this week, 130 House Republicans voted against the Trump-backed COVID relief checks, with many arguing they were unnecessary and would increase the federal budget deficit.\nThe Democratic-controlled House approved the larger payments, but the plan is dead in the Senate, another sign of Trump\u2019s fading hold over Congress.\nBesides his concerns about social media and military base names, Trump also said the defense bill restricted his ability to conduct foreign policy, \u201cparticularly my efforts to bring our troops home.\u2033 Trump was referring to provisions in the bill that impose conditions on his plan to withdraw thousands of troops from Afghanistan and Germany. The measures require the Pentagon to submit reports certifying that the proposed withdrawals would not jeopardize U.S. national security.\nTrump has vetoed eight other bills, but those were all sustained because supporters did not gain the two-thirds vote needed in each chamber for the bills to become law without Trump\u2019s signature.\nRhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Trump\u2019s Dec. 23 veto a \u201cparting gift\u201d to Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cand a lump of coal for our troops. Donald Trump is showing more devotion to Confederate base names than to the men and women who defend our nation.\u2033\nImportant conversations are happening now. Add your voice!

            "OAN Newsroom\nUPDATED 4:35 PM PT \u2013 Thursday, December 31, 2020\nThe Senate is preparing to debate whether or not to override the President\u2019s recent veto of the massive \u2018National Defense Authorization Act.\u2019\nImmediately following Wednesday\u2019s vote queuing up the impending discussion, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell filed a cloture motion, which placed a time limit on arguments.\nAmong the many reasons for the President\u2019s veto is a provision that calls to rename military bases that are named after confederate leaders. He also denounced the bill for upholding Section 230 rather than repealing it.\nOn Tuesday, however, McConnell asked his colleagues to continue to support the defense bill by saying it is vital for U.S. defense interests. President Trump called GOP lawmakers \u201cweak,\u201d and said the attempt to defy his veto was an act of cowardice.\nMeanwhile, the House already voted to dismiss the veto earlier this week, but some members of the Republican party are backing the President\u2019s play.\nRep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) stood by the decision to veto the NDAA because the bill serves foreign interests, not American interests. Sen. Rand Paul also urged his colleagues on both sides of the aisle to think about the bill, to stop sending money to countries who hate America and to vote for change.\nWhen I make the Senate vote to quit sending money to countries that hate us, only a handful vote with me. If you want change, vote for change \u2014 Democrats AND Republicans. https://t.co/VFM6M9tqT3 \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) December 31, 2020\nThe upper chamber will need two-thirds of the vote to move ahead. If the Senate does move to strike down the veto, it will mark the first dismissal of a presidential veto during President Trump\u2019s time in office.\nThe veto override vote could take place as early as Friday."

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) FILE - In this Dec. 30, 2020, file photo Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., walks to the Senate floor on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Congress on Friday overrode President Donald Trump\u2019s veto of a defense policy bill, a first by lawmakers since he took office nearly four years ago, ensuring that the measure becomes law. In an extraordinary New Year\u2019s Day session, the Republican-controlled Senate easily turned aside the veto, dismissing Trump\u2019s objections to the $740 billion bill and handing him a stinging rebuke just weeks before he leaves the White House. Trump lashed out on Twitter, saying the Senate missed an opportunity to eliminate protections for social media platforms that he said give \u201cunlimited power to Big Tech companies. Pathetic!!!\u2033 Trump also slammed lawmakers for rejecting his call to increase COVID-19 relief payments to $2,000: \u201cNot fair, or smart!\u2033 The 81-13 vote in the Senate on the widely popular defense bill followed an earlier 322-87 override vote in the House. The bill affirms a 3% pay raise for U.S. troops and guides defense policy, cementing decisions about troop levels, new weapons systems and military readiness, personnel policy and other military goals. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the \u201csweeping and overwhelmingly bipartisan votes\u201d in the House and Senate \u201cdelivered a resounding rebuke to President Trump\u2019s reckless assault on America\u2019s military and national security.\u2033 Trump\u2019s veto of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, \u201cwould have hurt the health, financial security and safety of our servicemembers, their families, our veterans and our allies and partners worldwide,\u2033 Pelosi said. \u201cInstead of keeping Americans safe, the president continues to use his final moments in office to sow chaos and undermine our security.\u2033 The defense bill, which now has the force of law, \u201clooks after our brave men and women who volunteer to wear the uniform,\u2033 said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a tremendous opportunity: to direct our national security priorities to reflect the resolve of the American people and the evolving threats to their safety, at home and abroad. It\u2019s our chance to ensure we keep pace with competitors like Russia and China.\u2033 The Senate override was delayed after Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., objected to moving ahead until McConnell allowed a vote on the Trump-backed plan to boost COVID relief payments to $2,000. McConnell did not allow that vote; instead he used his parliamentary power to set a vote limiting debate on the defense measure, overcoming a filibuster threat by Sanders and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Without a bipartisan agreement, a vote on the bill could have been delayed until Saturday night. Lawmakers, however, agreed to an immediate roll call Friday once the filibuster threat was stopped. Trump vetoed the defense measure last week, saying it failed to limit Twitter and other social media companies he claimed were biased against him during his failed reelection campaign. Trump also opposed language that allows for the renaming of military bases that honor Confederate leaders. ADVERTISEMENT Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a close Trump ally, hailed the override vote. \u201cToday, the Senate sent a strong message of support to our troops,\u2033 Inhofe said. \u201cNot only does this bill give our service members and their families the resources they need, but it also makes our nation more secure \u2014 pushing back against China and Russia (and) strengthening our cyber defenses.\u2033 Trump has succeeded throughout his four-year term in enforcing party discipline in Congress, with few Republicans willing to publicly oppose him. The bipartisan overrides on the defense bill showed the limits of Trump\u2019s influence in the final weeks of his term. Earlier this week, 130 House Republicans voted against the Trump-backed COVID relief checks, with many arguing they were unnecessary and would increase the federal budget deficit. The Democratic-controlled House approved the larger payments, but the plan fizzled in the Senate amid opposition from McConnell and other Republicans, another sign of Trump\u2019s fading hold over Congress. Only seven GOP senators voted with Trump to oppose the defense bill override. Forty Republicans \u2014 including the entire GOP leadership \u2014 voted for the override, along with 41 Democrats. Sanders and five other liberals who opposed the defense bill also voted against the override. Besides his concerns about social media and military base names, Trump also complained that the bill restricted his ability to withdraw thousands of troops from Afghanistan and Germany. The measure requires the Pentagon to submit reports certifying that the proposed withdrawals would not jeopardize U.S. national security. Trump has vetoed eight other bills, but those were all sustained because supporters did not gain the two-thirds vote needed in each chamber for the bills to become law without Trump\u2019s signature. Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Trump\u2019s Dec. 23 veto a \u201cparting gift\u201d to Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cand a lump of coal for our troops. Donald Trump is showing more devotion to Confederate base names than to the men and women who defend our nation.\u201d",
        "summarized_context": "Congress has successfully overridden President Donald Trump's veto of the defense policy bill, marking the first time lawmakers have done so during his presidency. The Republican-controlled Senate easily dismissed Trump's objections to the $740 billion bill, delivering a rebuke to the president just weeks before his term ends. The bill includes a 3% pay raise for U.S. troops and guides defense policy.

            "The House voted on Monday to override President Donald Trump\u2019s veto of a sweeping $740 billion defense bill that previously passed in both chambers of Congress with veto-proof majorities.\nThough some Republicans sided with the president, the 322-87 vote marked a rare bipartisan rebuke of Trump\u2019s agenda during his final days in office. The House needed 288 votes to override the veto. The Senate is expected to vote on the bill on Tuesday, where a two-thirds majority will also need to support overriding the veto in order to secure pay increases for troops and ensure that training regimens can continue.\nTrump had vetoed the bill, which is known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), on the basis that it did not repeal Section 230, a law that shields private internet companies from liability for what users post on their websites and allows them to take down or restrict content at their discretion. In a public message to Congress last week, he said that the law \u201cfacilitates the spread of foreign disinformation online, which is a serious threat to our national security and election integrity.\u201d\nBut Trump\u2019s targeting of Section 230 appears to be personal in nature: He has recently sparred with Twitter about its decision to place warnings on and restrict engagement with his false tweets about widespread election fraud. The company has also suggested that Trump could get banned from the platform once he is no longer in office.\nTrump also took issue with provisions in the bill that require the military to rename facilities named after figures in Confederate history, limit the amount of defense funds that could be used to construct his US-Mexico border wall, and impose additional oversight on the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, Germany, and South Korea.\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Trump wrote, \u201cthe Act fails to include critical national security measures, includes provisions that fail to respect our veterans and our military\u2019s history, and contradicts efforts by my Administration to put America first in our national security and foreign policy actions. It is a \u2018gift\u2019 to China and Russia.\u201d\nThe NDAA, which sets the defense priorities for the nation and distributes resources to US troops, has been passed every year for 59 years without fail. The House had previously passed the bill 335-78 and the Senate had passed it 84-13, both over the two-thirds threshold needed to override a veto.\nTrump\u2019s veto of the bill \u2014 one of nine over the course of his presidency \u2014 pitted members of his own party against each other. Before Monday, Congress had not successfully overridden any of his vetoes.\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who previously voted for the bill, and members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus had announced their intentions to reject the veto override ahead of Monday\u2019s vote. But others, including Rep. Mac Thornberry, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, signaled that they would override the veto. Though he did not mention Trump directly, Thornberry told his GOP colleagues in a note obtained by Politico that they should ignore \u201cdistortions or misrepresentations\u201d of the bill, and distributed fact sheets about the provisions of the bill with which the president took issue.\n\u201cYour decision should be based upon the oath we all took, which was to the Constitution rather than any person or organization,\u201d he reportedly said.",
            "The House voted to override President Trump\u2019s veto of a $740 billion defense spending and policy bill that he hoped would include language stripping Big Tech lawsuit liability protections.\nThe veto override now heads to the Senate, where Trump likely faces a similar defeat as early as Tuesday. It would be the first time in his presidency Trump has lost a veto fight.\nThe House voted to move the National Defense Authorization Act into law over Trump\u2019s objections after passing it with overwhelming support earlier this month.\nTrump objects to the NDAA for several reasons, but mainly because it excludes language he is seeking to punish social media giants for perceived biases against him and other conservatives. Trump wanted lawmakers to include a provision in the bill stripping out a lawsuit shield Big Tech has enjoyed for more than two decades. Trump also objected to a provision in the bill calling for the renaming of military installations now named after Confederate officers, and he opposed language in the bill limiting his authority to draw down troops overseas.\nWhile Trump has prevailed on eight vetoes during his presidency, he\u2019s likely to lose this fight.\nBoth chambers passed the NDAA in December with veto-proof majorities, although some GOP House members plan to uphold Trump\u2019s veto, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, of California, and the 40 members of the House Freedom Caucus.\nThe defense policy bill has passed Congress uninterrupted for nearly 60 years and is considered critical for military planning and national security. The current measure is particularly important in the wake of recent Russian cyberattacks on critical government operations, lawmakers said. The NDAA includes new funding for cybersecurity and restaffing of a cyber \u201cczar\u201d position.\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important to meet our obligations to our troops and to the national security of this country,\u201d House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat, said ahead of the vote.\nThe House voted to override the president after passing a measure that endorsed Trump\u2019s request that the federal government increase a new round of stimulus checks from $600 per individual to $2,000.\nTrump made the request Sunday night after signing into law a $900 billion COVID-19 relief measure that is bundled with a $1.4 trillion government funding bill. Trump sent Congress a message requesting the stimulus check increase and also called on Congress to rescind some of the fiscal 2021 measure that provided billions to foreign governments.\nCongress is not required to act on Trump\u2019s request."

        "context": "Trump rejected the bill, H.R. 6395 (116), last week after lawmakers refused to budge on his last-minute demand to include a repeal of legal protections for social media companies. He also objected to provisions in the bill that would remove the names of Confederate leaders from military bases and place restrictions on U.S. troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and Europe. But lawmakers in both parties closed ranks to salvage the popular legislation, which has become law each year for nearly six decades. This year's bill passed the House earlier this month 335-78 and a sailed through the Senate by a vote of 84-13. Monday's override vote was a rare rebuke of Trump by Republican lawmakers, who have been hesitant to cross the president even as he fights a losing legal and political battle to overturn the results of the presidential election. Republicans could have sunk the legislation if they sided with Trump and switched their votes en masse. But a slew of GOP lawmakers did switch votes \u2014 109 House Republicans voted to overturn Trump's veto compared to the 140 who supported the compromise bill earlier this month. Democrats, meanwhile, boosted their support for the bill, with 212 voting to override compared to 195 who supported the bill nearly three weeks ago. Ahead of the vote, lawmakers from both parties warned that torpedoing the bill would have harsh consequences for the military, with many key pay and benefit provisions expiring on Dec. 31. Leaders of the House Armed Services Committee underscored that Trump's chief objection is unrelated to national security and falls outside the panel's jurisdiction. \u201dThe president vetoed this because of something that isn't in the bill and was never going to be in the bill, something totally unrelated to national security,\u201d Armed Services Chair Adam Smith (D-Wash.) said. \u201dThere is literally no reason for to veto this bill for the reasons that the president did, and certainly no reason for us not to uphold what we did in passing this bill.\u201d The top Armed Services Republican, Mac Thornberry, pushed lawmakers to hold the line and noted that more than 80 percent of the House supported the same defense bill earlier this month. \u201dIt's the exact same bill,\u201d Thornberry said. \u201dNot a comma has changed.\u201d \u201dOur troops, the country, indeed the world is watching to see what we will do, whether we can tune out other difference and still come together to support the men and women of the military and American national security,\u201d he added. Rep. Mac Thornberry speaks during a news conference Oct. 29, 2019 at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC. | Alex Wong/Getty Images No lawmakers spoke in favor of upholding the veto ahead of the vote. The bill is named in honor of Thornberry, who is retiring from Congress after 13 terms in the House. Following Trump's veto last week, the Texas Republican circulated a note urging GOP lawmakers to base their votes on the myriad provisions in the bill rather than \u201ddistortions or misrepresentations\u201d about the legislation. A presidential veto has loomed over the must-pass bill for months. Trump first threatened to veto the defense bill over the summer after the Senate Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment from progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to force the renaming bases that honor Confederates over a three-year period. The House followed suit with a provision to rename bases within a year, and a compromise bill included Warren's provision. Trump also threatened to nix the bill late in negotiations between the House and Senate this month unless lawmakers repealed the online liability protections, known as Section 230. The issue is unrelated to national security, and many Republicans have called for a separate debate and vote on legislation to overhaul the law. Trump said he'd received a pledge for a vote on a repeal of Section 230 after signing a separate full-year government funding package and coronavirus stimulus on Sunday. \u201dCongress has promised that Section 230, which so unfairly benefits Big Tech at the expense of the American people, will be reviewed and either be terminated or substantially reformed,\u201d Trump said in a statement. Lawmakers in both parties contend Section 230 should be overhauled, but Democrats have rejected Trump's calls for a full repeal of the statute.",
        "summarized_context": "The House of Representatives has voted to override President Donald Trump's veto of the $740 billion defense bill, marking a rare bipartisan rebuke of Trump's agenda. The bill, known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), previously passed in both chambers of Congress with veto-proof majorities. Trump vetoed the bill because it did not repeal Section 230, a law that shields internet companies from liability for user content. The Senate is expected to vote on the bill on Tuesday. This is the first time in his presidency that Trump has lost a veto fight."

            "\u00a9 Spencer Platt/Getty Images Former Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg is attempting to boost Joe Biden in Florida.\nBillionaire Mike Bloomberg announced Sunday he would spend as much as $100 million in Florida to defeat President Donald Trump in his must-win state.\nThe infusion of cash comes as polls indicate a tightening of the race between Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden, who are deadlocked in a recent Marist Poll, and as Floridians start voting by mail at the end of the month.\nBiden\u2019s support among Hispanic voters is in double digits yet remains relatively low for a Democrat who wants to carry the state according to surveys of Latinos in Florida and Miami.\nTo that end, \u201ccommunicating with Hispanic voters will be a key part\u201d of Bloomberg\u2019s effort, which will primarily focus on digital and TV ads, according to a press release issued on behalf of his Independence USA political committee.\nVote-by-mail ballots voters start going out in six days to overseas voters. For domestic voters in the United States, the ballots will start being mailed out Sept. 24. Biden plans to visit Florida on Tuesday, his first trip to the state since the coronavirus lockdowns began in March.\nFlorida also has an in-person early voting period that varies by county and begins as early as Oct. 19 and ends as late as Nov. 1, two days before Election Day.\nAs much as 75 percent of Florida\u2019s vote could be cast before Election Day and, because of the way the state tabulates votes, it could be one of the first to report its results, although the state has a history of razor-thin election margins and recounts.\nBloomberg advisers hope that his cash will help tip the state in favor of Biden, all but killing Trump\u2019s chances to win the Electoral College. Also, they say, the Florida money should help free up Democratic efforts in other states.\n\u201cBattleground states will decide this election,\u201d said a Bloomberg press release, released after a Washington Post article that first reported the news on his behalf.\n\u201cMike's substantial investment in Florida will allow Democrats and the Biden campaign to invest heavily in other key states like Pennsylvania, which will be critical to a Democratic victory,\u201d the press release said. \u201cAnd, this will force Republicans and the Trump campaign to shift even more of their limited resources to Florida.\u201d\nBoth sides are already spending big on TV in the race in Florida, where Trump, Biden and their allies have spent and reserved $319 million in ad time, according to the TV commercial tracking firm Advertising Analytics.\nVideo: Rep. Tim Ryan on Biden campaign strategy in battleground states (FOX News)",
            "Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's onetime rival, billionaire Mike Bloomberg, will spend $100 million to get Biden elected in Florida.\n\u201cVoting starts on Sept. 24 in Florida so the need to inject real capital in that state quickly is an urgent need,\u201d Bloomberg adviser Kevin Sheekey said in a statement. \u201cMike believes that by investing in Florida it will allow campaign resources and other Democratic resources to be used in other states, in particular the state of Pennsylvania.\u201d\nTRUMP CONSIDERS SPENDING HIS OWN MONEY ON RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN: 'WHATEVER IT TAKES'\nBloomberg ran against Biden in the 2020 Democratic primary and dropped out of the race in March after his record spending failed to yield any wins on Super Tuesday beyond a single victory in the American Samoa caucuses.\nThe money will be funneled through Bloomberg's super PAC Independence USA and other Democratic organizations.\nBloomberg's team told the Washington Post he is planning to spend \u201dnine figures\u201d and wants to inspire other megadonors to pour money into the Biden campaign. The money will be mainly spent on television ads in English and Spanish, The Washington Post reported.\nThe billionaire and former Republican mayor of New York City made the decision after news that Trump was open to spending his own money on the race, The Washington Post reported.\nThe announcement comes days after the Cook Political Report moved Florida from its \u201dLean Democrat\u201d to \u201dToss Up\u201d category.\nTRUMP LANDS PUNCHES ON BIDEN, MEDIA, 'PHONY' POLLS IN NEVADA RALLY\n\u201d[A] more competitive Florida contest is good news for Pres. Trump, who can't afford to lose this state,\u201d Cook's national editor Amy Walter wrote in a blog post. \u201dEven so, many Democrats never expected Biden to be able to win here, having long written off the Sunshine State as a loser.\u201d\nMeanwhile, a pro-Trump The group named Preserve America was expected to go up with TV and digital commercials in early September in the battleground states of Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Preserve America is spending $30 million on its initial ad blitz.\nPresident Trump went after Bloomberg on Twitter on Sunday morning in an apparent reaction to the news.\n\u201dIn the highly competitive world of high tech, how come nobody has ever challenged Mini Mike Bloomberg and his very average, [and] supposedly outdated, 'stuff' that he sells to so many?\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201dDid he use his position as Mayor of New York to create what is now a monopoly? Just askin'?\u201d\nBloomberg famously spent nearly $1 billion of his own money on his own failed presidential bid, which lasted less than five months and ended without him winning any major primary contests in the Democratic primary season.\nBefore ending his campaign in March, Bloomberg faced a wave of accusations that he was trying to \u201dbuy\u201d his way to the Democratic nomination. The former mayor, whose net worth is estimated to exceed $60 billion, flooded the airwaves with $550 million in advertisements. That included $224 million for Super Tuesday states.\nOut of the 1,000 delegates up for grabs, Bloomberg only took dozens and failed to pick up wins in any major states. Instead, he only won the American Samoa caucuses.\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\nFox News' inquiry to Biden's campaign was not immediately returned.\nFox News' Paul Steinhauser, Sam Dorman and Kelly Phares contributed to this report."

        "context": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Bloomberg, who spent $1 billion of his own money on a failed 2020 presidential bid, will inject at least $100 million to help Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s campaign against President Donald Trump in Florida. FILE PHOTO: Former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg speaks by video feed during the 4th and final night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention, as participants from across the country are hosted over video links from the originally planned site of the convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S. August 20, 2020. 2020 Democratic National Convention/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo The billionaire\u2019s decision comes at a critical moment in the final 51 days of the race, with polls showing a close race in the battleground state and no financial advantage for the sitting president as voting gets under way later this month. Trump\u2019s initial financial supremacy over former Vice President Biden evaporated after the Republican\u2019s campaign spent freely and Democratic fundraising surged once the party\u2019s divisive primary ended. \u201cMike Bloomberg is committed to helping defeat Trump, and that is going to happen in the battleground states,\u201d said Bloomberg adviser Kevin Sheekey, who added that the ex-New York City mayor\u2019s spending \u201cwill mean Democrats and the Biden campaign can invest even more heavily in other key states like Pennsylvania, which will be critical to a Biden victory.\u201d Even before Bloomberg\u2019s spending, both campaigns were expecting Florida to be the most expensive state in which to campaign. It will be the biggest prize among competitive states on Election Day, offering 29 of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win. In-state voting by mail in Florida starts on Sept. 24, and Biden is planning his first in-person visit to Florida of the general election season on Tuesday. Trump won the state by 113,000 votes in his victorious 2016 election, or 1.2 percentage points. He has since adopted the state as his residence and visits regularly. Recent polls have shown Biden with a very slim margin there, gaining ground with older voters but trailing previous Democrats\u2019 performance with Latinos. People over 65 years old make up one in five of the state\u2019s population and Latinos make up one in four. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee on Wednesday said they raised a combined $210 million in August, falling far short of Biden\u2019s record-breaking haul of $364.5 million for the month that included both party\u2019s televised conventions. The strong fundraising may have allowed Biden to completely erase a long deficit in fundraising against Trump. Before the August fundraising tally, the Trump campaign reported having $300 million in cash on hand, compared with Biden\u2019s $294 million. Neither campaign has reported a more recent figure. The figures also do not include money being spent by outside groups. The candidates have already booked $58 million in advertisements to run between last Tuesday and the Nov. 3 election, more than any other single state, according to Advertising Analytics LLC, a market data firm. The Republican president, who trails Biden in national opinion polls, told reporters last week that he would spend money from his own real-estate and brand-licensing fortune, if needed. \u201cI thought Mini Mike was through with Democrat politics,\u201d Trump said on Twitter on Sunday. \u201cSave NYC instead.\u201d Democrats had worried that Bloomberg\u2019s promised help for the party might not come through after he abandoned his own presidential primary campaign. Some were angered by Bloomberg\u2019s getting a prime-time speaking slot at the Democratic convention in August and said that his spending to date did little to advance his candidacy or the party\u2019s chances. A Bloomberg aide said the money would be used to help bring people to the polls who support Biden and communicating with Latino voters, in particular. \u201cThis will force Republicans and the Trump campaign to shift even more of their limited resources to Florida,\u201d the aide said. Bloomberg won\u2019t be the only outside actor pouring money into the race. America First Action Inc, a group that supports Trump, said last week that it would spend $12.7 million on new ads in Florida targeting Biden. Unite the Country Inc, a similar group backing Biden, said last week that it is rolling out $1.4 million in targeted digital advertising aimed at persuading Latino voters in South Florida.",
        "summarized_context": "Former Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg has pledged to spend up to $100 million in Florida to help Joe Biden defeat President Donald Trump in the upcoming election. Bloomberg's investment comes as polls show a tightening race between Trump and Biden in the state. The funds will primarily be used for digital and TV ads, with a focus on reaching Hispanic voters. Florida is a crucial battleground state, and early voting begins at the end of September. Bloomberg's advisers hope that his financial support will tip the state in favor of Biden and force Republicans to shift their resources to Florida."
