            "\u00a9 Spencer Platt/Getty Images Former Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg is attempting to boost Joe Biden in Florida.\nBillionaire Mike Bloomberg announced Sunday he would spend as much as $100 million in Florida to defeat President Donald Trump in his must-win state.\nThe infusion of cash comes as polls indicate a tightening of the race between Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden, who are deadlocked in a recent Marist Poll, and as Floridians start voting by mail at the end of the month.\nBiden\u2019s support among Hispanic voters is in double digits yet remains relatively low for a Democrat who wants to carry the state according to surveys of Latinos in Florida and Miami.\nTo that end, \u201ccommunicating with Hispanic voters will be a key part\u201d of Bloomberg\u2019s effort, which will primarily focus on digital and TV ads, according to a press release issued on behalf of his Independence USA political committee.\nVote-by-mail ballots voters start going out in six days to overseas voters. For domestic voters in the United States, the ballots will start being mailed out Sept. 24. Biden plans to visit Florida on Tuesday, his first trip to the state since the coronavirus lockdowns began in March.\nFlorida also has an in-person early voting period that varies by county and begins as early as Oct. 19 and ends as late as Nov. 1, two days before Election Day.\nAs much as 75 percent of Florida\u2019s vote could be cast before Election Day and, because of the way the state tabulates votes, it could be one of the first to report its results, although the state has a history of razor-thin election margins and recounts.\nBloomberg advisers hope that his cash will help tip the state in favor of Biden, all but killing Trump\u2019s chances to win the Electoral College. Also, they say, the Florida money should help free up Democratic efforts in other states.\n\u201cBattleground states will decide this election,\u201d said a Bloomberg press release, released after a Washington Post article that first reported the news on his behalf.\n\u201cMike's substantial investment in Florida will allow Democrats and the Biden campaign to invest heavily in other key states like Pennsylvania, which will be critical to a Democratic victory,\u201d the press release said. \u201cAnd, this will force Republicans and the Trump campaign to shift even more of their limited resources to Florida.\u201d\nBoth sides are already spending big on TV in the race in Florida, where Trump, Biden and their allies have spent and reserved $319 million in ad time, according to the TV commercial tracking firm Advertising Analytics.\nVideo: Rep. Tim Ryan on Biden campaign strategy in battleground states (FOX News)",
            "Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's onetime rival, billionaire Mike Bloomberg, will spend $100 million to get Biden elected in Florida.\n\u201cVoting starts on Sept. 24 in Florida so the need to inject real capital in that state quickly is an urgent need,\u201d Bloomberg adviser Kevin Sheekey said in a statement. \u201cMike believes that by investing in Florida it will allow campaign resources and other Democratic resources to be used in other states, in particular the state of Pennsylvania.\u201d\nTRUMP CONSIDERS SPENDING HIS OWN MONEY ON RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN: 'WHATEVER IT TAKES'\nBloomberg ran against Biden in the 2020 Democratic primary and dropped out of the race in March after his record spending failed to yield any wins on Super Tuesday beyond a single victory in the American Samoa caucuses.\nThe money will be funneled through Bloomberg's super PAC Independence USA and other Democratic organizations.\nBloomberg's team told the Washington Post he is planning to spend \u201dnine figures\u201d and wants to inspire other megadonors to pour money into the Biden campaign. The money will be mainly spent on television ads in English and Spanish, The Washington Post reported.\nThe billionaire and former Republican mayor of New York City made the decision after news that Trump was open to spending his own money on the race, The Washington Post reported.\nThe announcement comes days after the Cook Political Report moved Florida from its \u201dLean Democrat\u201d to \u201dToss Up\u201d category.\nTRUMP LANDS PUNCHES ON BIDEN, MEDIA, 'PHONY' POLLS IN NEVADA RALLY\n\u201d[A] more competitive Florida contest is good news for Pres. Trump, who can't afford to lose this state,\u201d Cook's national editor Amy Walter wrote in a blog post. \u201dEven so, many Democrats never expected Biden to be able to win here, having long written off the Sunshine State as a loser.\u201d\nMeanwhile, a pro-Trump The group named Preserve America was expected to go up with TV and digital commercials in early September in the battleground states of Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Preserve America is spending $30 million on its initial ad blitz.\nPresident Trump went after Bloomberg on Twitter on Sunday morning in an apparent reaction to the news.\n\u201dIn the highly competitive world of high tech, how come nobody has ever challenged Mini Mike Bloomberg and his very average, [and] supposedly outdated, 'stuff' that he sells to so many?\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201dDid he use his position as Mayor of New York to create what is now a monopoly? Just askin'?\u201d\nBloomberg famously spent nearly $1 billion of his own money on his own failed presidential bid, which lasted less than five months and ended without him winning any major primary contests in the Democratic primary season.\nBefore ending his campaign in March, Bloomberg faced a wave of accusations that he was trying to \u201dbuy\u201d his way to the Democratic nomination. The former mayor, whose net worth is estimated to exceed $60 billion, flooded the airwaves with $550 million in advertisements. That included $224 million for Super Tuesday states.\nOut of the 1,000 delegates up for grabs, Bloomberg only took dozens and failed to pick up wins in any major states. Instead, he only won the American Samoa caucuses.\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\nFox News' inquiry to Biden's campaign was not immediately returned.\nFox News' Paul Steinhauser, Sam Dorman and Kelly Phares contributed to this report."

        "context": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Bloomberg, who spent $1 billion of his own money on a failed 2020 presidential bid, will inject at least $100 million to help Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s campaign against President Donald Trump in Florida. FILE PHOTO: Former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg speaks by video feed during the 4th and final night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention, as participants from across the country are hosted over video links from the originally planned site of the convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S. August 20, 2020. 2020 Democratic National Convention/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo The billionaire\u2019s decision comes at a critical moment in the final 51 days of the race, with polls showing a close race in the battleground state and no financial advantage for the sitting president as voting gets under way later this month. Trump\u2019s initial financial supremacy over former Vice President Biden evaporated after the Republican\u2019s campaign spent freely and Democratic fundraising surged once the party\u2019s divisive primary ended. \u201cMike Bloomberg is committed to helping defeat Trump, and that is going to happen in the battleground states,\u201d said Bloomberg adviser Kevin Sheekey, who added that the ex-New York City mayor\u2019s spending \u201cwill mean Democrats and the Biden campaign can invest even more heavily in other key states like Pennsylvania, which will be critical to a Biden victory.\u201d Even before Bloomberg\u2019s spending, both campaigns were expecting Florida to be the most expensive state in which to campaign. It will be the biggest prize among competitive states on Election Day, offering 29 of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win. In-state voting by mail in Florida starts on Sept. 24, and Biden is planning his first in-person visit to Florida of the general election season on Tuesday. Trump won the state by 113,000 votes in his victorious 2016 election, or 1.2 percentage points. He has since adopted the state as his residence and visits regularly. Recent polls have shown Biden with a very slim margin there, gaining ground with older voters but trailing previous Democrats\u2019 performance with Latinos. People over 65 years old make up one in five of the state\u2019s population and Latinos make up one in four. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee on Wednesday said they raised a combined $210 million in August, falling far short of Biden\u2019s record-breaking haul of $364.5 million for the month that included both party\u2019s televised conventions. The strong fundraising may have allowed Biden to completely erase a long deficit in fundraising against Trump. Before the August fundraising tally, the Trump campaign reported having $300 million in cash on hand, compared with Biden\u2019s $294 million. Neither campaign has reported a more recent figure. The figures also do not include money being spent by outside groups. The candidates have already booked $58 million in advertisements to run between last Tuesday and the Nov. 3 election, more than any other single state, according to Advertising Analytics LLC, a market data firm. The Republican president, who trails Biden in national opinion polls, told reporters last week that he would spend money from his own real-estate and brand-licensing fortune, if needed. \u201cI thought Mini Mike was through with Democrat politics,\u201d Trump said on Twitter on Sunday. \u201cSave NYC instead.\u201d Democrats had worried that Bloomberg\u2019s promised help for the party might not come through after he abandoned his own presidential primary campaign. Some were angered by Bloomberg\u2019s getting a prime-time speaking slot at the Democratic convention in August and said that his spending to date did little to advance his candidacy or the party\u2019s chances. A Bloomberg aide said the money would be used to help bring people to the polls who support Biden and communicating with Latino voters, in particular. \u201cThis will force Republicans and the Trump campaign to shift even more of their limited resources to Florida,\u201d the aide said. Bloomberg won\u2019t be the only outside actor pouring money into the race. America First Action Inc, a group that supports Trump, said last week that it would spend $12.7 million on new ads in Florida targeting Biden. Unite the Country Inc, a similar group backing Biden, said last week that it is rolling out $1.4 million in targeted digital advertising aimed at persuading Latino voters in South Florida.",

Bloomberg's decision to invest in Florida comes after news that Trump is open to spending his own money on the race. The Cook Political Report recently moved Florida from \"Lean Democrat\" to \"Toss Up\" category, indicating a more competitive race. Trump responded to Bloomberg's announcement on Twitter, questioning his business practices and suggesting he used his position as Mayor of New York to create a monopoly.

            "President Trump on Tuesday threatened to veto an annual defense bill authorizing nearly $1 trillion in military spending unless Congress opens the door for Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites to be held legally liable for the way they police their platforms.\nTrump delivered his ultimatum \u2014 calling for the repeal of a federal law known as Section 230 \u2014 in a pair of late-night tweets that transformed a critical national security debate into a political war over his unproved allegations that Silicon Valley\u2019s technology giants exhibit systemic bias against conservatives.\n\u201cSection 230, which is a liability shielding gift from the U.S. to \u2018Big Tech\u2019 (the only companies in America that have it \u2014 corporate welfare!), is a serious threat to our National Security & Election Integrity,\u201d Trump tweeted.\nUnless the \u201cvery dangerous & unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA),\u201d Trump continued, \u201cI will be forced to unequivocally VETO the Bill when sent to the very beautiful Resolute desk.\u201d\nSection 230: The little law that defined how the Internet worksFCC push to rethink legal protections for tech giants marks major turn amid months of political pressure\nSection 230 is a broad, decades-old federal law that spares a wide array of sites and services from being held liable for the content posted by their users \u2014 and, in the process, the decisions about the posts, photos and videos that tech companies take down or leave online. It is considered one of the Web\u2019s foundational laws, crafted in large part to facilitate free expression digitally.\nMany lawmakers \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 increasingly have come to question whether the protections are outdated, conferring legal immunity on tech giants at a time when they have failed to crack down on hate speech, election disinformation and other harmful content online. But Trump and his Republican allies have seized on the debate to advance their arguments that Facebook, Google, Twitter and others should be penalized for exhibiting systemic political bias against conservatives \u2014 a charge for which they have provided scant evidence, and one that tech giants long have denied.\nTrump has stepped up his attacks in recent months, particularly as social media companies have taken more aggressive action against his most controversial online posts \u2014 including his tweets falsely claiming he won the 2020 presidential election. Earlier this year, the president also signed a sweeping executive order that sought to give the government vast new power to police political speech on the Web, a directive later challenged in court over its constitutionality. And Trump has repeatedly urged state and federal investigators to use their broad investigatory powers to probe, and potentially punish, Silicon Valley over allegations of bias.\nSection 230 otherwise has no nexus with national security. A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment late Tuesday about the president\u2019s contention that the law puts the country at risk.\nTrump\u2019s ultimatum arrives after he previously threatened to veto the roughly $740 billion defense bill, known as the NDAA, over a provision that would require the Pentagon to change the names of 10 military installations that recognize Confederate military officers who fought to preserve slavery. Trump has said he will not allow that to happen, and he grew angry when defense officials said that Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, whom Trump has since fired, and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy had signaled openness to the bases being renamed.\nSen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told The Washington Post in an interview last month that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has a policy against putting bills on the floor for a vote when they have a veto threat.\nBut some Republicans in recent days have suggested a trade: Reforming Section 230 in exchange for the base-name changes that Democrats seek, according to a person familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to describe the private conversations. Democrats largely have balked at the idea, the source said.\nDan Lamothe contributed to this report.",

Trump has pulled back from threats to derail legislation in the past.

        "context": "PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday granted pardons to former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former adviser Roger Stone, sweeping away the most important convictions under the long-running Russia election probe. Trump also issued a pardon for Charles Kushner, a real estate developer and the father of Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Trump, taking advantage of a right granted by the Constitution only to the president, has issued two groups of pardons in as many days, and more are anticipated as Trump faces the end of his presidency on Jan. 20. The announcement came just after Trump arrived in Palm Beach, Florida, for the holiday season, with Jared Kushner on the Air Force One flight with him. In total, Trump issued on Wednesday pardons to 26 individuals and commuted part or all of the sentences of an additional three people. A commutation removes the punishment but leaves the conviction in place. Of special interest for Trump has been attacking the results of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign, a case Trump repeatedly dismissed as a political witch hunt. Reacting to Wednesday\u2019s pardons, Republican Senator Ben Sasse, in a six-word statement, said: \u201cThis is rotten to the core.\u201d Besides Manafort and Stone, Trump has pardoned two other major figures from the Russia probe, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former adviser George Papadopoulos. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, which has been trying to prosecute Manafort in New York for mortgage fraud and other alleged crimes, said it would continue to pursue an appeal for its case, which was dismissed on double jeopardy grounds. Slideshow ( 3 images ) \u201cThis action underscores the urgent need to hold Mr. Manafort accountable for his crimes against the People of New York as alleged in our indictment, and we will continue to pursue our appellate remedies,\u201d said Danny Frost, spokesman for the office. FIGURES IN RUSSIA INVESTIGATION The Manafort pardon spared the long-time Republican operative from serving the bulk of his 7-1/2-year prison term. Manafort, 70, was among the first in Trump\u2019s inner circle to face charges brought by Mueller as part of his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Manafort worked on Trump\u2019s White House campaign for five months in 2016. In 2018, Trump called him a \u201cbrave man\u201d for not cooperating with federal authorities. Evidence from the Russia investigation indicated that Trump intended to encourage Manafort \u201cnot to cooperate with the government,\u201d according to Mueller\u2019s report. In a statement relayed by his lawyer, Manafort expressed his appreciation to Trump. \u201cMr. President, my family & I humbly thank you for the Presidential Pardon you bestowed on me. Words cannot fully convey how grateful we are,\u201d he said. Slideshow ( 3 images ) Andrew Weissmann, a top Mueller deputy who oversaw Manafort\u2019s prosecution by the special counsel, noted that Manafort has served roughly two years of his sentence, and that assets seized in civil forfeiture proceedings would fall outside the pardon. \u201cSo, there still are consequences to Paul Manafort, they are just not commensurate with the extensive criminality that he was convicted of and plead guilty to,\u201d Weissmann said on CNN. Stone was convicted in November 2019 by a Washington jury of lying under oath to lawmakers also investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump commuted his sentence in July, a day before Stone was due to begin serving a term of three years and four months. Stone, in a statement, thanked Trump for \u201ccompletely erasing the criminal conviction to which I was subjected in a Soviet-style show trial on politically-motivated charges.\u201d Charles Kushner was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty in 2004 to 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering and making unlawful campaign donations. In an unusual twist, the man who prosecuted Charles Kushner was Chris Christie, now the former governor of New Jersey, who also has served as an adviser to Trump. Christie was quoted by CNN as saying Charles Kushner\u2019s case was \u201cone of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes\u201d he prosecuted. During the case, Charles Kushner admitted to smearing his brother-in-law, who had cooperated with prosecutors, by hiring a prostitute to have sex with him in a motel room, then sending a secretly recorded video of the encounter to the man\u2019s wife, Charles Kushner\u2019s own sister. A pardon in practice grants full legal forgiveness for a federal crime, as a result removing any remaining prison sentence, probation conditions or unpaid fines. It also relieves the person of the potential consequences of a felony conviction, such as being barred from voting, running for public office and owning a gun.",
        "summarized_context": "President Donald Trump has granted pardons to 26 individuals, including his friend Roger Stone, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner. Trump also commuted the sentences of three people. This follows his announcement the previous day to pardon or commute the sentences of 20 individuals, including corrupt former Republican congressmen, subjects of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, and Blackwater security guards involved in the killing of Iraqi civilians in 2007. The White House stated that Stone and Manafort were victims of the \"greatest witch hunt in American history.\" Stone was previously sentenced to 40 months in prison for witness tampering, lying to Congress, and obstructing the House investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in 2016. Trump commuted Stone's sentence in July, which was criticized by Mueller. The latest pardons and commutations highlight Trump's determination to challenge the results of the Russia probe before his term ends. Charles Kushner, a real estate developer and father of Jared Kushner, pleaded guilty to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations. Trump's clemency actions on Tuesday included pardoning Republican allies and individuals involved in the 2007 Baghdad massacre, as well as"

            "\u00a9 Erin Scott/Reuters The White House is seen on Thanksgiving day in Washington, D.C., Nov. 26, 2020.\nNewly unsealed documents reveal the Justice Department is looking into allegations that lobbyists may have tried to bribe White House officials or a related political committee in exchange for a presidential pardon.\nThe partially redacted documents, unsealed Tuesday by the chief judge on the D.C. district court, show that government investigators have seized communications related to an investigation into unidentified individuals who may have engaged in a \u201dsecret lobbying scheme\u201d to contact senior White House officials to secure \u201da pardon or reprieve of sentence\u201d for another unidentified individual.\n\u201cNo government official was or is currently a subject or target of the investigation disclosed in this filing,\u201d a DOJ official said in a statement late Tuesday.\nThe filing notes that some communications in question seized by the government were taken from the office of an unidentified lawyer near the end of this past summer.\nAccording to the documents, the government in August sought a court order \u201dso that the investigative team (could) access\u201d certain communications and confront individuals in the case in order to take \u201dinvestigative steps needed to complete its investigation.\u201d\nThe White House has declined to comment on the investigation.\nABC News' Ben Gittleson contributed to this report.",
            "The Justice Department is investigating whether there was a criminal bribery scheme involving political contributions being offered either to individuals in the Trump administration or to a related political organization in the hopes of obtaining a pardon from President Trump, according to newly unsealed federal court records.\nA heavily redacted 20-page order and memorandum from Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia from August was unsealed on Tuesday, revealing the existence of the DOJ inquiry. But, due to all of the names and most of the key details being blacked out, it offers the public little in the way of specifics, and there is currently no indication that the pardon that was being pursued materialized. Whether anyone in the White House was privy to such a scheme is also unclear.\nThe inquiry apparently revolves around DOJ investigators seeking access to discussions tied to possible Lobbying Disclosure Act violations and a bribery conspiracy scheme that were not covered under attorney-client privilege. The communications were seized by the U.S. government through search warrants, with the filter team reviewing more than 50 digital media devices, including iPhones, iPads, laptops, thumb drives, and computer and external hard drives totaling several terabytes of data, with some of the emailed communications \u201cindicating additional criminal activity.\u201d\nThe communications are related to a \u201csecret lobbying scheme\u201d in which \u201c[redacted] and [redacted] acted as lobbyists to senior White House officials without complying with the registration requirement of the Lobbying Disclosure Act\u201d in order to secure \u201ca pardon or reprieve of sentence for [redacted]\u201d as well as a \u201crelated bribery conspiracy scheme\u201d in which \u201c[redacted] would offer a substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentence for [redacted]\u201d by using \u201c[redacted] as the intermediaries to deliver the proposed bribe.\u201d\nA DOJ official told the Washington Examiner that \u201cno government official was or is currently a subject or target of the investigation disclosed in this filing.\u201d Seemingly in reference to the unsealed court filings, Trump tweeted on Tuesday night that the \u201cpardon investigation is Fake News!\u201d\nThe judge wrote in the summer that \u201cthe government now seeks a court order\u2019s that the investigative team may access these communications, confront [redacted], [redacted], and [redacted] with the facts recited herein, and take any other investigative steps needed to complete its investigation.\u201d\nTen pages of factual background were entirely blacked out.\n\u201c[Redacted] was neither hired nor supervised by [redacted], and did not report to [redacted] and thus in no way operated as an agent of [redacted]. At most, [redacted] provided merely a coordinating role, including with the [redacted] and the White House Counsel\u2019s office, to help ensure [redacted]\u2019s work on behalf of [redacted]\u2019 clemency petition reached the targeted officials,\u201d Howell wrote in one heavily redacted section. She also said: \u201c[Redacted], not [redacted] requested [redacted]\u2019s assistance \u2018as a personal favor\u2019 to use his political connections [redacted]. This political strategy to obtain a presidential pardon was \u2018parallel\u2019 to and distinct from [redacted]\u2019s role as an attorney-advocate for [redacted].\u201d\nIt is unclear who specifically the DOJ is scrutinizing.\n\u201cFor the foregoing reasons, email communications between and among [redacted], [redacted], and [redacted], or any agents of these individuals that were sent, copied, or forwarded to [redacted] in connection with the alleged LDA scheme or bribery-for-pardon scheme described in the government\u2019s motion are not covered by the attorney-client or other privilege,\u201d the judge concluded. \u201cThe investigative team may therefore review and use any such communications to confront subjects and targets of this investigation. To the extent that the filter team encounters any communications between [redacted] and [redacted] or [redacted], to which [redacted] is not a participant or recipient, that appear to implicate legal advice or representation unrelated to the alleged schemes and crimes described above, they shall be withheld from the investigative team and protected accordingly as required by law.\u201d\nThe possibility of Trump issuing more pardons has garnered more speculation as the president\u2019s term nears its end in January.\nThe New York Times reported on Tuesday that Trump has talked with his advisers about whether to grant preemptive pardons to some of his children \u2014 Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump \u2014 and to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as well as to his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. The report said that Trump spoke with the former New York City major about a possible pardon last week.\n\u201c#FakeNews NYT lies again,\u201d Giuliani tweeted in response to the article. \u201cNever had the discussion they falsely attribute to an anonymous source. Hard to keep up with all their lies.\u201d\nTrump has granted 29 pardons and commuted 16 prison sentences during his presidency. Among them were pardons for former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, former Dick Cheney aide Scooter Libby, conservative commentator Dinesh D\u2019Souza, former New York City Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik, and women\u2019s suffrage advocate Susan B. Anthony. Trump commuted the sentence of his longtime associate Roger Stone earlier this year, and he pardoned retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn last week. The former national security adviser had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in 2017 but subsequently declared his innocence, and the DOJ later moved to dismiss the case.\n"

        "context": "(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is investigating a potential crime related to funneling money to the White House in exchange for a presidential pardon, according to court documents unsealed in federal court. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell on Tuesday released a heavily redacted order that described what she called a \u201cbribery-for-pardon\u201d investigation. About half of the 18-page document was blacked out, with the publicly available version providing few details of the alleged scheme, and naming none of the people potentially involved. It said federal prosecutors in Washington said they had obtained evidence of a bribery scheme in which someone \u201cwould offer a substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentence.\u201d The order said prosecutors were also investigating a \u201csecret lobbying scheme\u201d in which two unidentified individuals \u201cacted as lobbyists to senior White House officials, without complying with the registration requirement of the Lobbying Disclosure Act.\u201d A Justice Department official said no government official is or was a target of the investigation. The Justice Department had to ask Howell\u2019s permission to view certain emails between a lawyer and clients, who were not identified. Howell granted the request in August, saying attorney-client privilege did not apply in that instance. Prosecutors had said they planned to \u201cconfront\u201d three unnamed individuals with the communications and finish their investigation. According to Howell\u2019s order, government investigators said they had seized \u201cover fifty digital media devices, including iPhones, iPads, laptops, thumb drives, and computer and external hard drives.\u201d Presidents enjoy wide latitude under the U.S. Constitution in pardoning people convicted of federal crimes. President Donald Trump last week pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. That was the first of what is expected to be a string of pardons in Trump\u2019s final weeks in the White House. According to Howell\u2019s order, the Justice Department had recently told her it wanted to keep the investigation from becoming public because it detailed \u201cindividuals and conduct\u201d that had not yet been charged.",

The investigation does not currently target any government officials. The White House has declined to comment on the matter. The court filings offer little in the way of specifics, as most names and key details are blacked out. The communications in question were seized by the government through search warrants, and the filter team has reviewed over 50 digital media devices. The investigation is focused on possible violations of the Lobbying Disclosure Act and a bribery conspiracy scheme. It is unclear who specifically the DOJ is scrutinizing. President Trump tweeted that the pardon investigation is \"Fake News.\" The possibility of Trump issuing more pardons has garnered speculation as his term nears its end in January.

            "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died on Friday. Her passing leaves a vacancy on the court in late September of a presidential election year\u2014seven months closer to Election Day than the vacancy that was left following the 2016 death of Justice Antonin Scalia.\nShortly after the news of that previous Supreme Court justice\u2019s death broke, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that his chamber would not consider a nominee to replace Scalia until after the 2016 election. \u201cThe American people\u200e should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President.\u201d\nThis time around, McConnell announced Friday night, the American people have said enough. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate,\u201d the bottom line read. It was preceded by some lawyerly language interpreting the previous six years\u2019 worth of electoral politics as proof positive that he had made the proper, fair decisions each step of the way. It\u2019s ignorable. There was a Supreme Court seat open in 2016 that he didn\u2019t want a Democrat to fill, so he kept it open. There is a Supreme Court seat open in 2020 that he wants a Republican to fill, so he\u2019ll try to fill it.\nIn order to do so, he needs 50 Republican votes plus Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s as a tiebreaker. This means he can only afford to lose three of his senators. He wouldn\u2019t commit to a floor vote if he didn\u2019t think he could get them. But he\u2019s putting his vulnerable Republican senators in an excruciating position.\nMaine Sen. Susan Collins, who\u2019s in a difficult reelection race in major part due to her deciding vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the court, told the New York Times earlier this month that she, in the Times\u2019 words, \u201cwould not seat a Supreme Court justice in October,\u201d and also that she would oppose seating a justice during the lame-duck session in the event of a transfer of power.\nAlaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who is not up for reelection this cycle, told Alaska Public Media in an interview Friday\u2014before she knew about Ginsburg\u2019s death\u2014that \u201cI would not vote to confirm a Supreme Court nominee. We are 50 some days away from an election.\u201d\nThat\u2019s two on the record already.\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who\u2019s also up for reelection, is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He told the Atlantic in 2018 that \u201cif an opening comes in the last year of President Trump\u2019s term, and the primary process has started, we\u2019ll wait to the next election\u201d\u2014and then added, \u201chold the tape.\u201d Here\u2019s the tape.\nColorado Sen. Cory Gardner is up for reelection in Colorado, which is now a lean-blue state. His career may be over already. It will certainly be over if he votes to confirm a new justice before the election. Sen. Martha McSally is trailing in her race in Arizona. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis is narrowly trailing in his. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst is an a tight race, while Texas Sen. John Cornyn, Montana Sen. Steve Daines, Georgia Sen. David Perdue, and, well, Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell all have races they can\u2019t sleep on. For some of them, it might be useful to enthusiastically activate their state\u2019s Republicans despite the ferocious backlash from Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters. For others it won\u2019t. They\u2019ll all have to figure that out immediately.\nThen there\u2019s Utah Sen. Mitt Romney. Would he go along with a straightforward power grab that would tear the country apart? Would retiring Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander?\nWhat McConnell\u2019s statement does not say is when \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d He left himself room, in other words, to hold the confirmation in the lame-duck session. If Trump wins reelection, that\u2019s the ballgame anyway. If Biden wins? Lame-duck senators won\u2019t be accountable anymore.\nDemocrats will be applying extraordinary pressure in the coming weeks on Republicans up for reelection in competitive races (and Mitt Romney!) to commit that they won\u2019t vote to confirm a nominee either before the election or in the lame-duck period. Those lame-duck Republicans could always change their word after the election. Some Democrats have already begun signaling that there would be consequences to that, too: an abolition of the filibuster and an expansion of the Supreme Court if Joe Biden becomes president and Democrats take the Senate majority.\nWe\u2019ve been in a slow-moving political crisis for some time. It\u2019s about to get fast. And the only certain thing is that Mitch McConnell will say it wasn\u2019t his fault.",
            "Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate will vote on President Trump\u2019s nominee to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on Friday.\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate,\u201d McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said in a lengthy statement praising Ginsburg as \u201cthoroughly dedicated to the legal profession.\u201d\nMcConnell referred back to his decision to punt on a nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in the final year of President Barack Obama\u2019s second term.\n\u201cSince the 1880s, no Senate has confirmed an opposite-party president\u2019s Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year,\u201d McConnell said.\nRepublicans control 53 votes and need 51 to confirm a nominee. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said earlier in the day on Friday that she\u2019ll oppose a new nominee until the next president is sworn into office.\nTrump announced a list of potential nominees on Sept. 9, but it remains unclear when he will nominate someone to the high court."

            "\u00a9 Reuters/LEAH MILLIS U.S. President Donald Trump holds a campaign event, in Allentown, Pennsylvania\nBy Jonathan Stempel\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday rejected a U.S. government request to drop Donald Trump as a defendant in a defamation lawsuit by a writer who said the president falsely denied raping her in a Manhattan department store a quarter century ago.\nU.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan refused to let the government substitute itself for Trump as a defendant in former Elle magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll's lawsuit.\nA ruling for the government would have shielded Trump from liability and likely doomed Carroll's defamation claim.\nCarroll had sued Trump last November in a New York state court, after he had denied having raped her in Bergdorf Goodman in the mid-1990s or knowing who she was. Trump said she fabricated the story to sell a new book, and added: \u201dShe's not my type.\u201d\nActing at the behest of Attorney General William Barr, the Department of Justice moved the case to federal court, where it said Trump acted in his official capacity when denying Carroll's claims, and thus could not be sued personally for defamation.\nBut Kaplan said a law shielding federal employees from being sued for acts done during their employment did not cover presidents. He also said Trump did not make his statements about Carroll in the scope of his employment as president.\n\u201dNo one even arguably directed or controlled President Trump when he commented on the plaintiff\u2019s accusation, which had nothing to do with the official business of government, that he raped her decades before he took office,\u201d Kaplan wrote in a 61-page decision. \u201dAnd no one had the ability to control him.\u201d\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\nCarroll's lawsuit is one of many legal actions Trump faces as he seeks reelection on Nov. 3.\nHe has denied the claims of several women who accused him of sexual misconduct occurring before he took office.\nRoberta Kaplan, a lawyer for Carroll, said they looked forward to pursuing the defamation case in federal court.\n\u201dThe simple truth is that President Trump defamed our client because she was brave enough to reveal that he had sexually assaulted her, and that brutal, personal attack cannot be attributed to the Office of the President,\u201d she said.\nCarroll said in a statement: \u201dWhen Donald Trump called me a liar and denied that he had ever met me, he was not speaking on behalf of the United States. I am happy that Judge Kaplan recognized these basic truths.\u201d\nNO FREEDOM TO DEFAME\nThe Justice Department moved the lawsuit to federal court after Justice Verna Saunders of a Manhattan state court had in August rejected Trump's bid to postpone the case.\nShe said the U.S. Supreme Court's recent rejection of Trump's claim of absolute immunity from criminal proceedings while in office applied to state court proceedings involving his unofficial or personal conduct.\nThat ruling could have allowed Carroll's lawyers to seek a DNA sample from Trump, to match against a dress Carroll said she wore at Bergdorf Goodman.\nThe Justice Department's intervention put that process on hold.\nBut the judge said its arguments went \u201dmuch too far\u201d by leaving Trump \u201dfree (to) defame anyone who criticizes his conduct or impugns his character,\u201d without consequences for the president and regardless of the harm to his target.\nKaplan said it would be different if Trump were being challenged in court over his official conduct.\n\u201dA comment about government action, public policy, or even an election is categorically different than a comment about an alleged sexual assault that took place roughly twenty years before the president took office,\u201d he wrote.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Additional reporting by Sarah N.

Jean Carroll, an author who accused him of rape, which he has vehemently denied.\nThe judge, Lewis Kaplan of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, rejected the DOJ's argument that the Justice Department should be allowed to take over the defense of the president.\nThe Trump administration claimed that the Federal Tort Claims Act, which allows the U.S. government to protect federal employees from individual damages claims, should apply in this case.\n\u201cThe government moves to substitute the United States for President Trump as the defendant. It does so in essence on the theory that this is not truly a lawsuit against President Trump as a private individual.\u201d Kaplan said in a 61-page opinion. \u201dInstead, the government argues, this is really a lawsuit against the United States because Ms. Carroll has sued an \u2018employee\u2019 of the United States of America for actions within the scope of his employment.\u201d\nKaplan added, \u201dThe President of the United States is not an \u2018employee of the Government\u2019 within the meaning of the relevant statutes. Even if he were such an \u2018employee,\u2019 President Trump's allegedly defamatory statements concerning Ms. Carroll would not have been within the scope of his employment. Accordingly, the motion to substitute the United States in place of President Trump is denied.\u201d\nThe judge then specifically shot down the Justice Department\u2019s claims that the Federal Tort Claims Act, which allows the U.S. government to protect federal employees from individual damages claims, should apply in this case.\n\u201cWhile the president possesses all of the executive power of the United States, he is not an 'employee' within the meaning of the FTCA,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cThe FTCA\u2019s definition of that term does not include presidents.\u201d\nCarroll, 76, filed a lawsuit against the president for defamation in November 2019 after he claimed he knew nothing about her and it never happened. Carroll alleged that Trump raped her in a dressing room at a famous New York City department store more than two decades ago. Carroll wrote a June 2019 article for the Cut where she claimed that \u201cDonald Trump assaulted me in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room 23 years ago. But he\u2019s not alone on the list of awful men in my life.\u201d\nTrump denied Carroll\u2019s claims that same month, including during an Oval Office interview. \u201cI\u2019ll say it with great respect: Number one, she\u2019s not my type. Number two, it never happened. It never happened, OK?\u201d the president said while seated behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. Trump also said Carroll was \u201ctotally lying. I don\u2019t know anything about her. I know nothing about this woman. I know nothing about her. She is \u2014 it\u2019s just a terrible thing that people can make statements like that.\u201d\nCarroll is looking to depose Trump and has requested that he provide a DNA sample to compare to genetic material she said is on a dress that she wore during the alleged sexual assault.\nThe Justice Department told the court in early September that \u201cthe President explained that these accusations were false and that the incident she alleged never happened\u201d and \u201cthe Attorney General\u2019s delegate has certified that President Trump was acting within the scope of his office as President of the United States when he publicly denied as false the allegations made by Plaintiff.\u201d The DOJ said \u201con the basis of this certification, the United States removed the action to this Court pursuant to the Westfall Act\u201d and \u201cpursuant to the same statute, the United States hereby moves the Court to substitute the United States as the party defendant in place of the President.\u201d\nCarroll\u2019s lawyer countered in October that \u201cthere is not a single person in the United States \u2014 not the President and not anyone else \u2014 whose job description includes slandering women they sexually assaulted\u201d and \u201cthey assert that Defendant Donald J. Trump was acting within the scope of his employment as President when he defamed Plaintiff E. Jean Carroll, a woman he sexually assaulted over twenty years ago, as retaliation for revealing his misconduct.\u201d\nAttorney General William Barr defended the Justice Department\u2019s move in September.\n\u201cThis has to do with something called the Westfall Act. That is an act that provides that when tort cases, state tort cases, are brought against government employees in the executive branch and in the legislative branch, and the tort was allegedly committed in the course of federal employment, the case can be certified for shifting to the federal courts and the United States can be substituted as the responsible party,\u201d Barr said during a September press conference, adding, \u201cThis was a normal application of the law, the law is clear, it is done frequently, and the little tempest that\u2019s going on is largely because of the bizarre political environment in which we live.\u201d\n\u201cThe undisputed facts demonstrate that President Trump was not acting in furtherance of any duties owed to any arguable employer when he made the statements at issue,\u201d Kaplan ruled Tuesday. \u201cHis comments concerned an alleged sexual assault that took place several decades before he took office, and the allegations have no relationship to the official business of the United States. To conclude otherwise would require the Court to adopt a view that virtually everything the president does is within the public interest by virtue of his office. The government has provided no support for that theory, and the Court rejects it as too expansive.\u201d\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to the Washington Examiner\u2019s request for comment."

U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan refused to let the government substitute itself for Trump as a defendant in former Elle magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll\u2019s lawsuit. A ruling for the government would have shielded Trump from liability and likely doomed Carroll\u2019s defamation claim. Carroll had sued Trump last November in a New York state court, after he had denied having raped her in Bergdorf Goodman in the mid-1990s or knowing who she was. Trump said she fabricated the story to sell a new book, and added: \u201cShe\u2019s not my type.\u201d Acting at the behest of Attorney General William Barr, the Department of Justice moved the case to federal court, where it said Trump acted in his official capacity when denying Carroll\u2019s claims, and thus could not be sued personally for defamation. But Kaplan said a law shielding federal employees from being sued for acts done during their employment did not cover presidents.

Carroll said in a statement: \u201cWhen Donald Trump called me a liar and denied that he had ever met me, he was not speaking on behalf of the United States. I am happy that Judge Kaplan recognized these basic truths.\u201d NO FREEDOM TO DEFAME The Justice Department moved the lawsuit to federal court after Justice Verna Saunders of a Manhattan state court had in August rejected Trump\u2019s bid to postpone the case. She said the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent rejection of Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity from criminal proceedings while in office applied to state court proceedings involving his unofficial or personal conduct. That ruling could have allowed Carroll\u2019s lawyers to seek a DNA sample from Trump, to match against a dress Carroll said she wore at Bergdorf Goodman. The Justice Department\u2019s intervention put that process on hold. But the judge said its arguments went \u201cmuch too far\u201d by leaving Trump \u201cfree (to) defame anyone who criticizes his conduct or impugns his character,\u201d without consequences for the president and regardless of the harm to his target. Kaplan said it would be different if Trump were being challenged in court over his official conduct. \u201cA comment about government action, public policy, or even an election is categorically different than a comment about an alleged sexual assault that took place roughly twenty years before the president took office,\u201d he wrote.",

In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, Justice Department lawyers said Winston Wolkoff, a former aide who fell out with the first lady, failed to submit to government for review a draft of her book, \u201cMelania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the First Lady,\u201d which offers an unflattering portrayal of President Donald Trump\u2019s wife. Winston Wolkoff, in a statement issued late on Tuesday, said she had fulfilled all the terms of her agreement with Melania Trump and the confidentiality provisions ended \u201cwhen the White House terminated the agreement.\u201d \u201cThe president and first lady\u2019s use of the U.S. Department of Justice to silence me is a violation of my First Amendment Rights and a blatant abuse of the government to pursue their own personal interests and goals,\u201d she said. She said she had exercised her right of free expression with the publication of her book and \u201cI will not be deterred by these bullying tactics.\u201d The complaint said the Justice Department has jurisdiction in the case because of the first lady\u2019s traditional public role dating back to Martha Washington, wife of the first U.S. president, George Washington. The government asked that any profits Winston Wolkoff might realize from the book and subsequent movie deal or documentaries be set aside into a \u201cconstructive trust,\u201d with the monies ultimately going to the Treasury Department. Slideshow ( 2 images ) Published six weeks ago, the book was for a time on the New York Times best seller list. It sells for $16.80 on amazon.com. \u201cThe United States seeks to hold Ms. Wolkoff to her contractual and fiduciary obligations and to ensure that she is not unjustly enriched by her breach of the duties she freely assumed when she served as an adviser to the first lady,\u201d said a copy of the complaint seen by Reuters. It says Winston Wolkoff and Mrs. Trump in August 2017 sealed a \u201cGratuitous Services Agreement\u201d related to \u201cnonpublic, privileged and/or confidential information\u201d that she might obtain during her service under the agreement. \u201cThis was a contract with the United States and therefore enforceable by the United States,\u201d said Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec. The government action was similar to Justice Department attempts to stop publication of a book published in June by former Trump national security adviser John Bolton. Bolton was accused of divulging national security secrets, a charge he denied. Publication went ahead any way and a court battle continues over his book, \u201cThe Room Where It Happened.\u201d Winston Wolkoff\u2019s tenure at the White House ended in early 2018 after it was disclosed that her company had received $26 million (\u00a320 million) to help plan Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017.",

Wolkoff's book, titled \"Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the First Lady,\" has been a bestseller and includes critical claims about Melania Trump and her time in the White House.

            "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Senate Judiciary Committee convened on Thursday set an Oct. 22 vote on Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s Supreme Court nomination as Republicans race to confirm President Donald Trump\u2019s pick before the Nov. 3 election.\nThe session is without Barrett after two long days of public testimony in which she stressed that she would be her own judge and sought to create distance between herself and past positions critical of abortion, the Affordable Care Act and other issues.\nHer confirmation to take the seat of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg seems inevitable, as even some Senate Democrats acknowledged.\nSen. Lindsey Graham pushed past Democratic objections to set the panel\u2019s Oct. 22 vote on recommending her confirmation even before final witnesses testify before and against her nomination. The committee set the vote for next week.\n\u201cThis is a sham,\u201d said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.\nIn the minority, Democrats acknowledge there is little they can do stop them from locking a conservative majority on the court for years to come. The shift would cement a 6-3 conservative majority on the court and would be the most pronounced ideological change in 30 years, from the liberal icon to the conservative appeals court judge.\nASSOCIATED PRESS Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett testifies during the third day of her confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 14, 2020. (Stefani Reynolds/Pool via AP)\nFacing almost 20 hours of questions from senators, the 48-year-old judge was careful not to take on the president who nominated her and sought to separate herself from writings on controversial subjects when she was an academic. She skipped past Democrats\u2019 pressing questions about ensuring the date of next month\u2019s election or preventing voter intimidation, both set in federal law, and the peaceful transfer of presidential power.\nShe also refused to express her view on whether the president can pardon himself. \u201cIt\u2019s not one that I can offer a view,\u201d she said in response to a question Wednesday from Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont.\nDemocrats raised those questions because President Donald Trump has done so himself.\nWhen it came to major issues that are likely to come before the court, including abortion and health care, Barrett repeatedly promised to keep an open mind and said neither Trump nor anyone else in the White House had tried to influence her views.\n\u201cNo one has elicited from me any commitment in a case,\u201d she said.\nNominees typically resist offering any more information than they have to, especially when the president\u2019s party controls the Senate, as it does now. But Barrett wouldn\u2019t engage on topics that seemed easy to swat away, including that only Congress can change the date that the election takes place.\nShe said she is not on a \u201cmission to destroy the Affordable Care Act,\u201d though she has been critical of the two Supreme Court decisions that preserved key parts of the Obama-era health care law. She could be on the court when it hears the latest Republican-led challenge on Nov. 10.\nBarrett is the most open opponent of abortion nominated to the Supreme Court in decades, and Democrats fear that her ascension could be a tipping point that threatens abortion rights.\nThere was no hiding her views in at least three letters and ads she signed over 15 years and her membership in Notre Dame\u2019s Faculty for Life. So Republican senators embraced her stance, proudly stating that she was, in Graham\u2019s words, an \u201cunashamedly pro-life\u201d conservative who is making history as a role model for other women.\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said there \u201cis nothing wrong with confirming a devout pro-life Christian.\u201d\nASSOCIATED PRESS Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett attends her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Wednesday, Oct. 14, 2020, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, Pool)\nBarrett refused to say whether the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade ruling on abortion rights was correctly decided, though she signed an open letter seven years ago that called the decision \u201cinfamous.\u201d\nDemocrats pressed repeatedly on the judge\u2019s approach to health care, abortion, racial equity and voting rights, but conceded they were unlikely to stop her quick confirmation.\n\u201cWhen you are on the court,\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., began one question in which he asked her to keep an open mind on the high court bench. Barrett readily agreed to do so.\nIn an exchange with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Barrett resisted the invitation to explicitly endorse or reject the late Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s comments about perpetuating \u201cracial entitlement\u201d in a key voting rights case.\n\u201cWhen I said that Justice Scalia\u2019s philosophy is mine, too, I certainly didn\u2019t mean to say that every sentence that came out of Justice Scalia\u2019s mouth or every sentence that he wrote is one that I would agree with,\u201d Barrett said.\nShe called the Voting Rights Act a \u201ctriumph in the civil rights movement,\u201d without discussing the specifics of the earlier challenge to it. The court will hear another challenge to the law early next year.\nOne of the more dramatic moments came late Wednesday when Barrett told California Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, that she wouldn\u2019t say whether racial discrimination in voting still exists nor express a view on climate change.\nHarris asked if she agreed with Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote in a 2013 voting rights case that \u201cvoting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that.\u201d\nBarrett said she would \u201cnot comment on what any justice said in an opinion.\u201d\nAsked whether \u201cclimate change is happening,\u201d Barrett said she wouldn\u2019t engage because it is \u201ca very contentious matter of public debate.\u201d Barrett did, however, say she believes the novel coronavirus is infectious and that smoking causes cancer.\nAlong with trying to undo the health care law, Trump has publicly stated he wants a justice seated for any disputes arising from the election, and particularly the surge of mail-in ballots expected during the pandemic as voters prefer to vote by mail.\nBarrett testified she has not spoken to Trump or his team about election cases, and declined to commit to recusing herself from any post-election cases.\nShe did describe what the role of the court would be if it were asked to intervene. \u201cCertainly the court would not see itself \u2015 and would not be \u2015 electing the president. It would be applying laws that are designed to protect the election and protect the right to vote,\u201d Barrett said.\nIn 2000, the court\u2019s decision in Bush v. Gore brought a Florida recount to a halt, effectively deciding the election in George W. Bush\u2019s favor. Barrett was on Bush\u2019s legal team in 2000, in a minor role.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick, Matthew Daly and Jessica Gresko in Washington, and Elana Schor in New York contributed to this report.",
            "The Senate Judiciary Committee set an Oct. 22 vote on advancing the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett despite objections from Democrats who say the matter should wait until the next president takes office.\nSenators voted along party lines, 12-10, to move forward with the vote next week. The vote sets in motion the likely confirmation of Barrett in the days before the Nov. 3 election.\nMinority Whip Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, first objected by arguing the proceeding lacked a proper quorum of at least two minority members of the panel.\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, told Democrats they would move ahead with a vote if they were in the same position.\n\u201cIf we create this problem for you in the future, you are going to do what I\u2019m going to do, which is move forward on the business of the committee.\u201d\nLawmakers argued back and forth over whether Barrett\u2019s nomination should proceed.\n\u201cCertainly you could have waited until the election was over, and then gone forward, but Republicans are willing to shred every principle of what this place has stood for,\u201d Sen Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said.\nThe vote followed two days of questioning of Barrett, a judge on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals.\nOn Thursday, lawmakers will hear from outside witnesses who support or oppose Barrett\u2019s confirmation."

        "context": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-led U.S. Senate on Thursday moved a step closer to confirming President Donald Trump\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court choice Amy Coney Barrett, with the Judiciary Committee scheduling an Oct. 22 vote on her nomination despite Democratic objections. The fourth and final day of the committee\u2019s confirmation hearing for the conservative appellate judge wrapped up with testimony from outside experts. Democrats protested what they called the rushed nature of the proceedings and complained that Barrett had sidestepped questions about presidential powers, abortion, climate change, voting rights and Obamacare. Republicans are aiming for a final confirmation vote on the Senate floor by the end of October following next week\u2019s committee vote. \u201cI believe that this rushed, sham process is a disservice to our committee,\u201d Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said. \u201cShe has been rushed in a way that is historically unprecedented ... and the purpose of doing it is simply to have a justice on the Supreme Court, as the president said, to decide the election and to strike down the Affordable Care Act.\u201d The Republican president has asked the Senate to confirm Barrett before the Nov. 3 U.S. election in which he is seeking a second term in office. Trump has said he expects the court to decide the election\u2019s outcome. With Republicans holding a 53-47 Senate majority, her confirmation seems assured. Barrett\u2019s confirmation would give the Supreme Court a 6-3 conservative majority. Barrett, 48, could serve for decades, alongside Trump\u2019s two other Supreme Court selections, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. \u201cThere is no way you will ever convince me that Amy Coney Barrett is not qualified, using any reasonable standards of qualification,\u201d said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, the committee chairman. Barrett answered questions from senators during marathon sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday. Outside witnesses testified in favor and against Barrett\u2019s nomination on Thursday. Barrett was not present. Despite some tense moments, the hearing was conducted largely with a congenial tone. It stood in contrast to the Kavanaugh\u2019s contentious 2018 confirmation hearings in which he angrily denied sexual assault allegations. At the end, Graham told the Democratic senators, \u201cYou have challenged the judge, you have challenged us, and I accept those challenges as being sincere and not personal. I don\u2019t think anybody crossed the line with the judge in terms of trying to demean her as a person.\u201d A SENATORIAL HUG The committee\u2019s top Democrat, Senator Dianne Feinstein, praised Graham for the manner in which he conducted the hearing. Feinstein and Graham then hugged at the end of the hearing. The liberal activist group Demand Justice afterward called on Feinstein to step down as the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat. The committee heard from two representatives from the American Bar Association, a national nonpartisan lawyers\u2019 group that deemed Barrett \u201cwell qualified\u201d after an evaluation of her \u201cintegrity, professional competence and judicial temperament.\u201d Slideshow ( 8 images ) Democratic senators again raised a number of misgivings about Barrett\u2019s potential votes on the Supreme Court on matters ranging from gun control to criminal justice matters, and expressed concern that she avoided answering many critical questions including whether a president can delay an election and queries related to transitions of power. \u201cWhat was the purpose of this hearing if we\u2019ve reached the point now where we really don\u2019t know what she thinks about any issues?\u201d Democratic Senator Dick Durbin asked. \u201cI would be afraid to ask her about the presence of gravity on Earth. She may decline to answer because it may come up in a case - you know, it could come before the court some day,\u201d Durbin added. Slideshow ( 8 images ) Democrats were upset that Senate Republicans proceeded with the confirmation process for Trump\u2019s nominee so close to an election after refusing to act on Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 Supreme Court nominee because it was an election year. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said Americans want the winner of the election to decide who fills the court\u2019s vacancy created by the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. If confirmed, Barrett could be on the Supreme Court in time to participate in a Nov. 10 case in which Trump and Republican-led states are seeking to invalidate the 2010 Obamacare law, formally called the Affordable Care Act.",
        "summarized_context": "The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a vote on Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court nomination for October 22, despite objections from Democrats who argue that the confirmation should wait until after the election. The vote is expected to advance Barrett's nomination and secure her confirmation before the November 3 election. Democrats raised concerns about the rushed process and the potential impact on issues such as abortion rights and healthcare. However, Republicans pushed forward with the vote, stating that Barrett is a qualified candidate and that they have the majority to confirm her. The confirmation of Barrett would solidify a 6-3 conservative majority on the court, marking a significant ideological shift. The committee's decision to proceed with the vote has been met with criticism from Democrats, who argue that it undermines the integrity of the nomination process. The confirmation hearing for Barrett lasted two days, during which she emphasized her independence as a judge and distanced herself from past controversial positions. She refused to comment on certain issues, such as the date of the election and the president's ability to pardon himself. Democrats expressed concerns about Barrett's views on healthcare, abortion, racial equity, and voting rights, but acknowledged that they are unlikely to be able to stop her confirmation.

            "\u00a9 Provided by Washington Examiner\nLawmakers in both parties are set to defy President Trump\u2019s threat to veto a key defense policy bill over military base names and social media liability protection.\nTrump tweeted on Monday that he\u2019ll veto the 2021 Defense Authorization Act, which sets annual spending levels and policy for the military unless it includes a new provision to strip a federal liability shield from social media companies, which he believes have worked to silence him and other conservative voices on Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms.\nTrump also wants to rid the defense bill of a provision authored by former presidential campaign opponent Sen. Elizabeth Warren calling for the renaming of U.S. military bases that are currently named after Confederate military officers.\nBut House and Senate lawmakers said that despite Trump\u2019s looming opposition, they aren\u2019t interested in a partisan battle over the must-pass measure, and the defense bill appears poised to pass, likely this month.\nThe National Defense Authorization Act is among a trio of priority legislation that includes fiscal 2021 spending and a critical coronavirus aid package lawmakers are rushing to negotiate by year's end.\nSen. James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said the National Defense Authorization Act is poised to pass this month with at least two-thirds support from the Senate, which would provide a veto-proof majority.\n\u201cThis is going to pass,\u201d Inhofe told reporters on Wednesday.\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, is also ready to bring the defense bill up for a vote in the House, a senior Democratic aide told the Washington Examiner. While the timing of the vote is not set, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he is aiming to complete House business for the year by Dec. 11.\nTrump has threatened to veto the defense bill over the base name change provision.\nIn July, Trump tweeted that Inhofe assured him the Warren provision would not be included in the bill.\n\u201cLike me, Jim is not a believer in \u2018Cancel Culture,\u2019\u201d Trump tweeted on July 24.\nBut Inhofe confirmed on Wednesday that the Warren provision remains in the bill to ensure Democratic support.\nInhofe said he agrees with Trump\u2019s criticism of the social media liability shield, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. But Inhofe said it should remain out of the defense bill because adding it will prompt House Democrats to refuse to draft a critical compromise bill between the House and Senate versions.\n\u201cI feel just as passionate about that as he does,\u201d Inhofe told reporters. \u201cThe only difference of opinion that we have is, I don't want it on this bill \u2026 because the Democrats will not appoint conferees\u201d to draft a compromise.\nSection 230 provides websites and social media sites broad protection from lawsuits while also allowing them to remove or moderate content.\nTrump and other Republicans have grown increasingly critical of Section 230 in the wake of incidents involving the removal or editing of content posted by conservatives and the president.\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee, run by Republicans, summoned the CEOs of Facebook and Twitter prior to the election to explain why they blocked a New York Post story about an alleged trove of Hunter Biden emails that suggested the family corruptly cashes in on its relationship to Joe Biden.\nRepublicans accused the social media companies of utilizing their platforms to hurt Trump and help Biden.\n\u201cThere is growing bipartisan concern with Big Tech and their abuse of power, and Section 230 is in serious need of reform,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican.\nRepublicans said on Wednesday that while they agree the shield law needs to be revised, the work should happen in the Senate Commerce Committee, not the Armed Services Committee.\nThey are also opposed to delaying passage of the bill, which authorizes spending levels and is critical for military planning.\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably a more appropriate place to do it,\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, told the Washington Examiner. \u201cOur military deserve to have authorization.\u201d\nThe Warren provision has already garnered bipartisan support.\nIn a media call with reporters on Wednesday, Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, said he would be \u201creluctant to put the bill on the floor\u201d without it.\nHe called Trump\u2019s reluctance to rename the bases \u201ca racist position to take, an extraordinarily unfortunate position for the president's take.\u201d\nBut some polls show Trump sides with a majority of the public.\nAn ABC News-Ipsos poll taken in June found 56% opposed changing Confederate-named military bases, compared to 42% who backed making the changes.\nAmong those surveyed, 67% of black people and 54% of Hispanics supported renaming those bases.\nTags: News, Congress\nOriginal Author: Susan Ferrechio\nOriginal Location: Trump-weary Congress moves to circumvent defense bill veto threat",

He is going to put pressure on Congress to step up on this.\u201d\nMr. Trump has threatened to veto the massive defense legislation more than once, as his primary criticism of the bill stems from language that would mandate the names of 10 military bases that honor Confederate leaders be changed.\nMr. Inhofe confirmed that the legislation, sponsored by Ms. Warren, made it into the final version of the NDAA.

        "context": "Senate Armed Services Chair Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) said that while he agrees with Trump on Section 230, the provision \u201chas nothing to do with the military.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t do it in this bill. That\u2019s not a part of the bill,\u201d Inhofe said, adding that he has conveyed that belief to Trump. In a pair of tweets Tuesday evening, Trump threatened to veto the bill if it does not include a full repeal of Section 230, which he has criticized as an unfair protection for social media companies whom the president believes are biased against him. \u201cAt this last minute, this sudden threat on an item that\u2019s not even part of a defense bill. \u2026 I don\u2019t think we could do it in a thoughtful, logical way at all,\u201d Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told POLITICO. \u201cIt seems to be more out of spite than anything else,\u201d Reed said of the president\u2019s threat, warning that Trump\u2019s posture jeopardizes several important policy moves, including a pay raise for U.S. troops. The House is also set to move forward with a compromise defense bill that doesn\u2019t alter Section 230, according to two House Democratic aides. The president\u2019s Twitter broadside puts Republicans in a bind as they look to maintain the support of Trump and his base heading into the Georgia runoffs next month that will determine control of the Senate. If GOP lawmakers back Trump, they risk tanking the popular military policy bill that's become law each year for nearly six decades; if they buck him by ignoring his complaints or overriding a veto, they risk stoking Trump\u2019s ire. Still, Republicans on Wednesday showed some signs of exasperation with the president\u2019s latest effort. As one GOP lawmaker put it: \u201cRepublicans are sick of this shit.\u201d Another Republican, Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, put it more delicately. While he said he understood the president\u2019s frustrations with Section 230, it was not worth imperiling the broader defense bill. \u201cThe NDAA is so important to the men and women that wear the uniform that this should not be an item to veto the act over,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I would hope he would reconsider his position on it.\u201d And Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said his \u201cpreference\u201d would be to pass the NDAA and then address Section 230 separately. Some lawmakers are already working with the White House to try to address the president\u2019s demands. Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, said he submitted possible legislative language to the White House on Section 230. \u201cThis was not an idea I had advocated. I\u2019m simply trying to be of assistance to the committee \u2026 and to the administration,\u201d Wicker said, adding that he doesn\u2019t believe the president will ultimately veto the NDAA. The top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, retiring Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, urged lawmakers to close ranks and pass the bill. \u201dThe purpose of the bill has always been to support our troops and to protect American national security,\u201d Thornberry said in a statement. \u201dDisagreements on all other issues have been put aside. This year should be no different.\u201d Not all of Trump's allies on Capitol Hill want him to back off from a fight on the defense bill. \u201cI hope we can do it,\u201d said Senate Judiciary Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). \u201cIf I were him, I\u2019d use all the leverage I could.\u201d Some Senate Republicans have been pushing to include changes to the online shield short of repeal in the defense bill. Separately, Graham\u2019s panel is slated to vote on a bill Wednesday to alter Section 230. Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, indicated Trump may be open to curbing the law. \u201dRight now they\u2019re getting a free ride to be editors and publishers to censor certain conservative messages,\u201d Kudlow said in an interview on Fox Business. \u201dWe don\u2019t like that one bit, and the president believes the NDAA is one way to amend that and make it better. \u201dHe\u2019s not dictating the language yet, but he wants an amendment that would essentially curb in one way shape or form the unbridled liability protection shield that these firms have,\u201d Kudlow added. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a co-sponsor of the only bipartisan bill targeting Section 230 to advance out of committee this Congress, called the veto threat \u201ddeeply dangerous and just plain stupid.\u201d He added, \u201cReforming Section 230 deserves its own debate \u2014 one that I\u2019ve helped lead in Congress, and which I look forward to continuing with a more serious, thoughtful administration in January.\u201d Blumenthal\u2019s bill, the EARN IT Act, would puncture a hole in the Section 230 immunity by opening online companies up to federal and state civil lawsuits for hosting child porn. The Section 230 push is the second time Trump has threatened to nix the defense bill this year. Over the summer, Trump promised to veto any defense legislation that would remove the names of Confederate leaders from 10 Army bases, even though provisions that would rename bases were included in both House and Senate bills with bipartisan support. The final defense bill does include a provision that would spur the Pentagon to remove the names over a three-year period, according to an aide for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who authored the proposal. The provision was included in the Senate-passed bill. Renaming bases has been one of the thornier issues for negotiators, with Democrats digging in against Trump. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) reiterated that the provision is a deal-breaker for Democrats. Morning Defense The latest news in defense policy and politics.

The Senate finally agreed Wednesday to name its slate of members to formal talks with the House on a compromise defense bill. Even though negotiations have been ongoing for months between the leaders of the Senate and House Armed Services committees and their staffs, the procedural move is needed to formally bring a final defense bill up for a vote. The NDAA is expected to be one of the last major pieces of legislation that passes this year, and during Trump's presidency. Lawmakers are aiming to leave the nation\u2019s capital in the coming days ahead of the holidays, but must still work out a funding deal to stave off a government shutdown by the end of next week. Congressional leaders are also eyeing another round of coronavirus economic relief that has been stalled for months. \u201cName a time that it's not this way,\u201d Graham said. \u201cName a time where we\u2019re done Dec. 1, go home and enjoy Christmas. I mean, it\u2019s always this way.\u201d Burgess Everett, Sarah Ferris, Heather Caygle, Melanie Zanona and Cristiano Lima contributed to this report.",
        "summarized_context": "Lawmakers in Congress are set to pass the 2021 Defense Authorization Act, despite President Trump's threat to veto the bill. Trump has called for the inclusion of a provision to strip social media companies of their liability protection and the removal of a provision calling for the renaming of military bases currently named after Confederate military officers. However, lawmakers from both parties have stated that they are not interested in a partisan battle over the bill and are confident it will pass with a veto-proof majority. The bill is part of a trio of priority legislation that also includes fiscal 2021 spending and a coronavirus aid package. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman James Inhofe has informed Trump that the bill does not include the provisions he requested, stating that they do not belong in the defense bill. Trump has threatened to veto the bill multiple times, primarily due to the base renaming provision. However, it remains unclear whether the bill will receive a veto-proof majority."

            "Michael Flynn exits federal court in Washington, DC, on Monday, June 24, 2019. Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg/Getty Images\nPresident Trump has tweeted that he has \u201cgranted a Full Pardon\u201d to former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\u201dIt is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!\u201d Trump tweeted.\nThe Department of Justice was not consulted on the pardon but was given a heads-up on Wednesday, according to a Department of Justice official.\n\u201cWe would have preferred to see if Judge Sullivan would act and for the matter to be resolved in court. We were confident in the likelihood of our success in the case,\u201d the official said. \u201cThat being said, this is obviously an appropriate use of the President\u2019s pardon power.\u201d\nFlynn's tenure at the White House lasted just a few weeks \u2014 he resigned early 2017 after getting caught in a public lie about his Russian contacts.\nHe pleaded guilty in late 2017 to lying to the FBI about those contacts, but later disavowed his plea and tried to get the case thrown out. In a shocking twist this spring, the Justice Department abandoned the case, which is still tied up in legal limbo.\nThroughout the saga, Flynn has narrowly avoided being sentenced.\nHe's also become an emblem of Trump's persistent efforts to undermine the Russia investigation and a conduit for testing the separation of powers between judges and prosecutors.\nRep. Adam Schiff, manager of the House impeachment investigation into Trump and chairman of the House Intel Committee, reacted to Trump\u2019s pardon of Flynn this afternoon.\nSchiff said in a statement, \u201cThere is no doubt that a president has broad power to confer pardons, but when they are deployed to insulate himself, his family, and his associates from criminal investigation, it is a corruption of the Framer\u2019s intent.\u201d\nSome background: To date, Trump's record on presidential pardons has been marked by personal connections, showmanship and an aversion to going through official government channels.\nBeneficiaries have won clemency by getting their requests to Trump through friends, Fox News personalities or Hollywood celebrities who talk to the President. That unusual pipeline has worked for people like Joe Arpaio, a former Arizona sheriff, Dinesh D'Souza, right-wing commentator, and Michael Milken, a financier convicted of securities fraud.\nCNN's Christina Carrega contributed to this report.\nCNN's Kaitlan Collins has more:",
            "President Donald Trump pardoned former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn on Wednesday, taking direct aim at a Russia investigation he has long insisted was motivated by political bias.\nTrump tweeted:\n\u201dIt is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!\u201d\nBefore the pardon, Flynn tweeted a Bible verse, Jeremiah 1:19, which reads:\n\u201d'They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you and will rescue you,' declares the Lord.\u201d\nFlynn is the second Trump associate convicted in the Russia probe to be granted clemency by the president. Trump commuted the sentence of longtime confidant Roger Stone just days before he was to report to prison. It is part of a broader effort to undo the results of an investigation that for years has shadowed his administration and yielded criminal charges against a half dozen associates.\nThe action voids the criminal case against Flynn just as a federal judge was weighing, skeptically, whether to grant a Justice Department request to dismiss the prosecution despite Flynn's own guilty plea to lying to the FBI about his Russia contacts.\nThe move is likely to energize supporters who have taken up the case as a cause celebre and rallied around the retired Army lieutenant general as the victim of what they assert is an unfair prosecution. Trump himself has repeatedly spoken warmly about Flynn, even though special counsel Robert Mueller's prosecutors once praised him as a model cooperator in their probe into ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign.\nThe pardon is the final step in a case defined by twists and turns over the last year after the Justice Department abruptly move to dismiss the case, insisting Flynn should have never been interviewed by the FBI in the first place, only to have U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan refuse the request and appoint a former judge to argue against the federal government's position.\nIn the months since, a three-judge panel's decision ordering Sullivan to dismiss the case was overturned by the full appeals court, which sent the matter back to Sullivan. At a hearing in September, Flynn lawyer Sidney Powell told the judge she had discussed the Flynn case with Trump but also said she did not want a pardon \u2014 presumably because she wanted him to be vindicated in the courts.\nPowell emerged separately in recent weeks as a public face of the Trump's election challenge of Joe Biden, but the Trump legal team ultimately distanced itself from her after she advanced a series of uncorroborated conspiracy claims.\nThe pardon spares Flynn the possibility of any prison sentence, which Sullivan could potentially have imposed had he ultimately decided to reject the Justice Department's dismissal request. That request was made in May after a review of the case by a federal prosecutor from St. Louis who had been specially appointed by Attorney General William Barr.\nFlynn acknowledged lying during the FBI interview by saying he had not discussed with the then-Russian Amb. Sergey Kislyak, sanctions that had just been imposed on Russia for election interference by the outgoing Obama administration. During that conversation, Flynn urged Kislyak for Russia to be \u201deven-keeled\u201d in response to the punitive measures, and assured him \u201dwe can have a better conversation\u201d about relations between the two countries after Trump became president.\nThe conversation alarmed the FBI, which at the time was investigating whether the Trump campaign and Russia had coordinated to sway the election's outcome. In addition, White House officials were stating publicly Flynn and Kislyak had not discussed sanctions.\nBut last May, the Justice Department abruptly reversed its position in the case. It said the FBI had no basis to interview Flynn about Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the United States, and that any statements he may have made were not relevant to the FBI's broader counterintelligence probe. It cited internal FBI notes showing agents had planned to close out their investigation into Flynn weeks earlier.\nFlynn was ousted from his position in February 2017 after news broke he had indeed discussed sanctions with Kislyak, and former Obama administration officials had warned the White House he could be vulnerable to blackmail.\nFlynn was among the first of the president's aides to admit guilt in Mueller's investigation and cooperated extensively for months. He provided such extensive cooperation that prosecutors did not recommend any prison time and suggested they would be fine with probation.\nBut on the morning he was to have been sentenced, after a stern rebuke about his behavior from Sullivan, Flynn asked for the hearing to be cut short so he could continue cooperating and earn credit toward a more lenient sentence.\nAfter that, though, he hired new attorneys \u2014 including Powell, a conservative commentator and outspoken critic of Mueller's investigation \u2014 who took a far more confrontational stance to the government.\nThe lawyers accused prosecutors of withholding documents and evidence they said was favorable to the case and repeatedly noted that one of the two agents who interviewed Flynn was fired from the FBI for having sent derogatory text messages about Trump during the 2016 campaign."

        "context": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump on Wednesday pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Trump\u2019s pardon, which could be the first of several after he lost the 2020 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden, drew condemnation from Democrats and other critics. A retired Army general, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about interactions he had with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States in the weeks leading up to Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017. He has since sought to withdraw the plea, arguing that prosecutors violated his rights and duped him into a plea agreement. His sentencing has been deferred several times. \u201cIt is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter, a day before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. Flynn\u2019s attorney, Sidney Powell, who told a court in September she personally asked Trump not to pardon her client, said the pardon was \u201cbittersweet\u201d because Flynn was innocent Trump\u2019s move was the highest-profile pardon he has granted since he took office. Among others, the Republican president has pardoned Army personnel accused of war crimes in Afghanistan and Joe Arpaio, a former Arizona sheriff and hardliner against illegal immigration. \u201cThis pardon is undeserved, unprincipled, and one more stain on President Trump\u2019s rapidly diminishing legacy,\u201d House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said in a statement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it \u201can act of grave corruption and a brazen abuse of power.\u201d FILE PHOTO: Former national security adviser Michael Flynn exits a vehicle as he arrives for his sentencing hearing at U.S. District Court in Washington, U.S., December 18, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst MUELLER INVESTIGATION Flynn served as Trump\u2019s first national security adviser but the president fired him after only 24 days for lying to Vice President Mike Pence as controversy broke over the former general\u2019s contacts with then-Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Flynn was one of several former Trump aides to plead guilty or be convicted at trial in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Moscow\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. election to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy. Russia denied meddling. In May, Attorney General William Barr stunned many in the legal community by ordering prosecutors to have the case dropped, a decision that came after Trump repeatedly complained that Flynn was being treated unfairly. Flynn and the Trump administration said U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who presided over the case, was required by law to grant the request for dismissal. An appeals court in August denied Flynn\u2019s request to order Sullivan to end the case. \u201cThe President has pardoned General Flynn because he should never have been prosecuted,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u201cIn fact, the Department of Justice has firmly concluded that the charges against General Flynn should be dropped. This Full Pardon achieves that objective, finally bringing to an end the relentless, partisan pursuit of an innocent man.\u201d The president has spent the days since the Nov. 3 election seeking to overturn the results and refusing to concede to Biden. On Monday, he allowed his administration to take part in a transition to a Biden White House, but he has continued to challenge the election\u2019s legitimacy. With less than two months before Inauguration Day, he could focus his remaining time in office on more pardons and other moves to burnish his legacy. Two former White House officials said more pardons were likely. \u201c\u201dThis is one unfettered presidential power the president enjoys using,\u201d one of them said. \u2018NOT LEARNED HIS LESSON\u2019 Trump said in March he was strongly considering a full pardon for Flynn. He said the FBI and Justice Department had \u201cdestroyed\u201d Flynn\u2019s life and that of his family, and cited an unspecified, unsubstantiated report that they had lost records related to Flynn. Flynn was supposed to help cooperate with the government as part of his plea deal. But he later switched lawyers and tactics, arguing that prosecutors in the case had tricked him into lying about his December 2016 conversations with Kislyak. The Justice Department has repeatedly denied allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, and Sullivan rejected all of Flynn\u2019s claims in December 2019. Federal prosecutors had asked the judge in January to sentence Flynn to up to six months in prison, arguing in a court filing that \u201cthe defendant has not learned his lesson. He has behaved as though the law does not apply to him, and as if there are no consequences for his actions.\u201d Flynn also served as head of the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Intelligence Agency but was forced out in 2014 in part due to his management style and opinions on how to fight Islamist militancy. He joined the Trump 2016 election campaign and at the Republican National Convention that year led supporters in chants of \u201cLock her up,\u201d in reference to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Other former Trump aides were convicted of federal crimes following the Russia inquiry. Trump\u2019s longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone was sentenced on Feb. 20 to three years and four months in prison for obstruction of justice, witness tampering and lying to lawmakers investigating the Russian election interference. Trump commuted his sentence. Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, was sentenced last year to 3-1/2 years in prison after being convicted of unlawful lobbying and witness tampering, which combined with a sentence in a related case equaled a term of more than seven years behind bars. Manafort was released from prison in May and is serving the rest of his sentence at home.",
        "summarized_context": "President Trump has granted a full pardon to former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his Russian contacts. The Department of Justice was not consulted on the pardon, but was given a heads-up. Flynn's resignation from the White House in 2017 came after he was caught lying about his Russian contacts. He later disavowed his guilty plea and tried to get the case thrown out. The Justice Department abandoned the case earlier this year. Trump's record on presidential pardons has been marked by personal connections and an aversion to going through official government channels. Flynn is the second Trump associate convicted in the Russia probe to be granted clemency by the president. The pardon voids the criminal case against Flynn just as a federal judge was weighing whether to dismiss the prosecution. The move is likely to energize supporters who believe Flynn was unfairly prosecuted. The pardon spares Flynn from any prison sentence."

            "\u00a9 Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attend the coronavirus task force press briefing at the White House on March 20.\nPresident Trump addressed the ongoing cyber hacks of the U.S. government for the first time on Saturday, seeking to turn blame away from Moscow in defiance of mounting evidence while downplaying how devastating the intrusions appear to be.\nIn a bizarre outburst on Twitter that Trump\u2019s critics condemned for its alarming disconnect from the facts, the president contradicted his top diplomat, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who on Friday pinned the breaches that have afflicted at least five major federal agencies \u201cclearly\u201d on Russia. Rather, the president baselessly suggested that the true culprit \u201cmay be China (it may!)\u201d\nTrump\u2019s aversion to calling out the Kremlin for its malign activities in cyberspace and his deference to Russian President Vladimir Putin has become a hallmark of his presidency. He has repeatedly trusted the word of Putin over the assessments of his own intelligence community, including its conclusion that Russia waged a sophisticated campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential election \u2014 a verdict Trump believes calls into question the legitimacy of his victory four years ago.\nHis tweets Saturday raise fresh concerns that he will seek to shrug off what may turn out to be a cyber hack of unprecedented scale, and that Russia will not be held to account. The president has complained to advisers, who believe Russia is culpable, that the intrusions are a fake narrative meant to damage him politically.\n\u201cThe Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality,\u201d Trump tweeted, despite a federal alert in recent days that called the widespread cyber espionage campaign \u201ca grave risk to\u201d government agencies and the private sector.\n\u201cI have been fully briefed and everything is well under control,\u201d he said, while agencies are scrambling to investigate and contain major breaches at agencies including the State, Treasury, Energy, Homeland Security and Commerce departments \u2014 an effort that is likely to take months.\nHe also speculated, with no evidence, that the hacks may also have included \u201ca hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big.\u201d Twitter flagged that assertion, saying that \u201cmultiple sources called this election differently.\u201d There is no evidence that November\u2019s election was undermined by significant or widespread fraud, despite Trump\u2019s insistence otherwise.\nTrump had, until Saturday, studiously avoided the topic, reluctant to address publicly an issue that has bedeviled him since he took office: Russia\u2019s hacking of U.S. targets. He broke his silence only after he was criticized publicly by lawmakers from both parties for an apparent unwillingness to confront Putin.\nWhite House officials had drafted a statement to be released Friday accusing Moscow of carrying out the cyber intrusions in a months-long campaign, but they were blocked from doing so, said a senior administration official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter\u2019s sensitivity.\nBut Pompeo, in an interview on \u201cThe Mark Levin Show,\u201d had no qualms about speaking out. \u201cThis was a very significant effort,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think it\u2019s the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity.\u201d\nPompeo did not specify which branch of the Russian government carried out the campaign, but U.S. officials have privately said they believe it is the foreign intelligence service, the SVR, a successor agency to the KGB. None have suggested that China played any role.\nMoscow has denied any involvement in the intrusions. Federal agencies were first revealed to have been hacked last weekend.\nPompeo said he could not say much more as the investigations were ongoing. \u201cBut suffice it to say, there was a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside of U.S. government systems, and it now appears systems of private companies and companies and governments across the world as well,\u201d he told Levin, a syndicated radio talk show host.\nHis remarks come as government agencies and affected companies race to figure out the scope of the breaches, how the Russians carried them off without being detected for months and how to prevent future compromises.\nThe president is intent on turning the conversation to China and its coercive activities in the technology and economic spheres and its human rights abuses, a second official said. He has directed advisers to look for ways in the waning days of his administration to confront Beijing over those issues, the official said.\nTrump\u2019s comments Saturday reflect a long-running disregard for the facts and his disinterest in what he calls \u201cthe cyber,\u201d analysts and former aides said. \u201cStarting with Trump\u2019s very first meeting with Putin to today\u2019s tweets we\u2019ve seen an almost unbreakable pattern of denying the obvious about Russia\u2019s misdeeds while carrying water for the Kremlin,\u201d said Andrew Weiss, a Russia expert and vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cTrump\u2019s comments are totally divorced from reality.\u201d\nGregory F. Treverton, a former chairman of the National Intelligence Council, the government\u2019s senior-most provider of intelligence analysis, said that Trump \u201cbehaves so much like a paid Russian agent.\u201d\n\u201cIf you look at the string of his actions and pronouncements,\u201d Treverton said, \u201cthe only consistent interpretation that you can logically draw is that he\u2019s in their thrall.\u201d\n\u00a9 Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images President Trump walks with Russian President Vladimir Putin at last year\u2019s G-20 Summit in Osaka, Japan.\nThe Obama administration saw that campaign, as disturbing as it was, as classic espionage of the sort that states routinely engage in against each other, rather than as a disruptive attack, and so did not retaliate, said Michael Daniel, who was Obama\u2019s White House cyber coordinator. Officials were not aware of the thousands of other victims in the private sector and other countries at the time, he said. The administration never publicly accused Russia of perpetrating the hacks.\nThis time, the context is different. There is widespread publicity around the breaches, which could turn out to be unprecedented in scale. The nature of the compromises, involving corruption of software commonly used by thousands of large organizations around the globe, is alarming. And the public is much more attuned to Russia\u2019s malign activity in cyberspace, in the wake of its 2016 election interference.\nThus far, there is no sign that the intrusions have resulted in disruption or destruction, and the SVR is known mostly for conducting espionage. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, the activity is not a precursor to something beyond spying, some analysts said.\nIn any case, Pompeo\u2019s \u201cattribution is a very important step,\u201d said Tom Bossert, who was Trump\u2019s homeland security adviser until April 2018. \u201cThe United States can now direct its focus and unite the world against this outrage.\u201d\nHe said the Russian government is holding American networks at risk. \u201cWe must impose a cost on the Russians,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil we start defending digital infrastructure as if commercial and government operations depended on it, we will remain rudderless.\u201d\nMicrosoft, a major software and cloud provider, alerted several federal agencies last weekend to the fact that they were breached, its president Brad Smith told The Washington Post in an interview this past week.\n\u201cNo one should be shocked that a company like Microsoft would be the first to identify any particular customer that has been breached,\u201d he said.\nSmith said so far the company has notified a little more than 40 customers who were breached, and that 80 percent of them were in the United States. The others were in Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Spain, Britain, Israel and the United Arab Emirates.\nBritain so far has seen only a small number of victims, all in the private sector.\nA major avenue for breaching victims\u2019 networks was an update for computer software made by a Texas-based company called SolarWinds. The firm said about 18,000 customers that received the patch, for network management software called Orion, were potentially exposed. The Russians covertly added malware to the update, which installed a back door on computers that the hackers could use to enter a victim\u2019s system at will.\nBut the intruders were selective in choosing who to compromise. Not everyone who downloaded the patch was seen as an attractive target, Microsoft said.\nThe SolarWinds update was not the only path into victims\u2019 networks, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in an alert this past week. \u201cCISA has evidence of additional initial access vectors, other than the SolarWinds Orion platform; however, these are still being investigated,\u201d the agency said.\nMicrosoft is itself a SolarWinds customer and acknowledged in a statement this past week it had found SolarWinds malware \u201cin our environment,\u201d which it isolated and removed.\nIn his interview with The Post, Smith said none of Microsoft\u2019s customers had been breached through the software giant. \u201cI think we can give you a blanket answer that affirmatively states, no, we are not aware of any customers being attacked through Microsoft\u2019s cloud services or any of our other services, for that matter, by this hacker.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cLots of people have been hacked and a lot of the people that have been hacked happen to be Microsoft customers and Microsoft cloud customers. But that doesn\u2019t mean they were hacked or attacked through the Microsoft cloud.\u201d\nSmith in a blog post called for the establishment of a global norm forbidding the type of \u201cbroad and reckless activity\u201d used against SolarWinds and its customers, which threatened the integrity of the broader software supply chain.\nA norm against compromising that supply chain would \u201ckneecap intelligence collection\u201d by western democracies, said Thomas Rid, a cyber espionage expert at Johns Hopkins University. Worse, nondemocratic states would not abide by it, he said. \u201cSome of the most successful western intelligence operations were supply chain compromises,\u201d he said, citing a decades-long operation in which rigged encryption machines allowed U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on dozens of countries undetected.\nDaniel, the former White House cyber coordinator, said a broad-based supply chain compromise that affects many different organizations indiscriminately \u201cshould probably be frowned upon.\u201d But, he said, to argue that a western spy agency is never going to use the supply chain to spy on an adversary is unrealistic. \u201cFor a well-defended adversary,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s something you may want to consider.\u201d\nKaren DeYoung contributed to this report.",
            "President Trump on Saturday downplayed the widespread hack of government systems and Russia\u2019s involvement, contradicting his secretary of state.\nThe president tweeted that the \u201clamestream\u201d media exaggerated the scale of the cyberattack and continued to be fixated on \u201cRussia, Russia, Russia.\u201d\nIn the tweet, he also tagged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said it was \u201cpretty clear\u201d the Kremlin was behind the attack which hit multiple agencies but so far appears to have missed the Pentagon.\n\u201cThe Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality. I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a series of tweets.\nHe said China remains a suspect in the cyberattack, which Mr. Pompeo did not rule out.\n\u201cRussia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!). There could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big, making it an even more corrupted embarrassment for the USA.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly what the hackers were seeking, but experts say it could include nuclear secrets, blueprints for advanced weaponry, COVID-19 vaccine-related research and information for dossiers on key government and industry leaders.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still unpacking precisely what it is, and I\u2019m sure some of it will remain classified,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said in an interview late Friday with radio talk show host Mark Levin. \u201cBut suffice it to say there was a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside of U.S. government systems and it now appears systems of private companies and companies and governments across the world as well. This was a very significant effort, and I think it\u2019s the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity.\u201d\nRussia has said it had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with the hacking.\nThe Democratic leaders of four House committees given classified briefings by the administration on the hack issued a statement complaining that they \u201cwere left with more questions than answers.\u201d\n\u201cAdministration officials were unwilling to share the full scope of the breach and identities of the victims,\u201d they said.\nMr. Pompeo said Russia was on the list of \u201cfolks that want to undermine our way of life, our republic, our basic democratic principles. \u2026 You see the news of the day with respect to their efforts in the cyberspace. We\u2019ve seen this for an awfully long time, using asymmetric capabilities to try and put themselves in a place where they can impose costs on the United States.\u201d\nWhat makes this hacking campaign so extraordinary is its scale: 18,000 organizations were infected from March to June by malicious code that piggybacked on popular network-management software from an Austin, Texas, company called SolarWinds.\nIt\u2019s going to take months to kick elite hackers out of the U.S. government networks they have been quietly rifling through since as far back as March.\nExperts say there simply are not enough skilled threat-hunting teams to duly identify all the government and private-sector systems that may have been hacked. FireEye, the cybersecurity company that discovered the intrusion into U.S. agencies and was among the victims, has already tallied dozens of casualties. It\u2019s racing to identify more.\nMany federal workers \u2014 and others in the private sector \u2014 must presume that unclassified networks are teeming with spies. Agencies will be more inclined to conduct sensitive government business on Signal, WhatsApp and other encrypted smartphone apps.\n\u201cWe should buckle up. This will be a long ride,\u201d said Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and former chief technical officer of the leading cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. \u201cCleanup is just phase one.\u201d\nThe only way to be sure a network is clean is \u201cto burn it down to the ground and rebuild it,\u201d Schneier said.\nFlorida became the first state to acknowledge falling victim to a SolarWinds hack. Officials told The Associated Press that hackers apparently infiltrated the state\u2019s health care administration agency and others.\nSolarWinds\u2018 customers include most Fortune 500 companies, and it\u2019s U.S. government clients are rich with generals and spymasters.\nIf the hackers are indeed from Russia\u2019s SVR foreign intelligence agency, as experts believe, their resistance may be tenacious. When they hacked the White House, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the State Department in 2014 and 2015 \u201cit was a nightmare to get them out,\u201d Alperovitch said.\nThe Pentagon has said it has so far not detected any intrusions from the SolarWinds campaign in any of its networks - classified or unclassified.\n\u2022 This article includes wire service reports.\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Surrounded by Army cadets, President Donald Trump watches the first half of the 121st Army-Navy Football Game in Michie Stadium at the United States Military Academy, Saturday, Dec. 12, 2020, in West Point, N.Y. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Contradicting his secretary of state and other top officials, President Donald Trump on Saturday suggested without evidence that China \u2014 not Russia \u2014 may be behind the cyber espionage operation against the United States and tried to minimize its impact. In his first comments on the breach, Trump scoffed at the focus on the Kremlin and downplayed the intrusions, which the nation\u2019s cybersecurity agency has warned posed a \u201cgrave\u201d risk to government and private networks. \u201cThe Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality. I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control,\u201d Trump tweeted. He also claimed the media are \u201cpetrified\u201d of \u201cdiscussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!).\u201d There is no evidence to suggest that is the case. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said late Friday that Russia was \u201cpretty clearly\u201d behind the operation against the United States. \u201cThis was a very significant effort and I think it\u2019s the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,\u201d Pompeo said in the interview with radio talk show host Mark Levin. Officials at the White House had been prepared to put out a statement Friday afternoon that accused Russia of being \u201cthe main actor\u201d in the hack, but were told at the last minute to stand down, according to one U.S. official familiar with the conversations who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. It is not clear whether Pompeo got that message before his interview, but officials are now scrambling to figure out how to square the disparate accounts. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the statement or the basis of Trump\u2019s claims. The State Department also did not respond to questions about Pompeo\u2019s remarks. Throughout his presidency, Trump has refused to blame Russia for well-documented hostilities, including its interference in the 2016 election to help him get elected. He blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, has endorsed allowing Russia to return to the G-7 group of nations and has never taken the country to task for allegedly putting bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. Pompeo in the interview said the government was still \u201cunpacking\u201d the cyberespionage operation and some of it would likely remain classified. \u201cBut suffice it to say there was a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside of U.S. government systems and it now appears systems of private companies and companies and governments across the world as well,\u201d he said. Though Pompeo was the first Trump administration official to publicly blame Russia for the intrusion, cybersecurity experts and other U.S. officials have been clear over the past week that the operation appears to be the work of Russia. There has been no credible suggestion that any other country \u2014 including China \u2014 is responsible. Democrats in Congress who have received classified briefings have also affirmed publicly that Russia, which in 2014 hacked the State Department and interfered through hacking in the 2016 presidential election, was behind it. It\u2019s not clear exactly what the hackers were seeking, but experts say it could include nuclear secrets, blueprints for advanced weaponry, COVID-19 vaccine-related research and information for dossiers on government and industry leaders. ADVERTISEMENT Russia has said it had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with the hacking. While Trump downplayed the impact of the hacks, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has said it compromised federal agencies as well as \u201ccritical infrastructure.\u201d Homeland Security, the agency\u2019s parent department, defines such infrastructure as any \u201cvital\u201d assets to the U.S. or its economy, a broad category that could include power plants and financial institutions. One U.S. official, speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss a matter that is under investigation, described the hack as severe and extremely damaging. \u201cThis is looking like it\u2019s the worst hacking case in the history of America,\u201d the official said. \u201cThey got into everything.\u201d Trump had been silent on the hacks before Saturday. Deputy White House press secretary Brian Morgenstern on Friday declined to discuss the matter, but told reporters that national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien had sometimes been leading multiple daily meetings with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence agencies, looking for ways to mitigate the hack. \u201cRest assured we have the best and brightest working hard on it each and every single day,\u201d he said. The Democratic leaders of four House committees given classified briefings by the administration on the hack have complained that they \u201cwere left with more questions than answers.\u201d \u201cAdministration officials were unwilling to share the full scope of the breach and identities of the victims,\u201d they said. Pompeo, in the interview with Levin, said Russia was on the list of \u201cfolks that want to undermine our way of life, our republic, our basic democratic principles. ... You see the news of the day with respect to their efforts in the cyberspace. We\u2019ve seen this for an awfully long time, using asymmetric capabilities to try and put themselves in a place where they can impose costs on the United States.\u201d What makes this hacking campaign so extraordinary is its scale: 18,000 organizations were infected from March to June by malicious code that piggybacked on popular network-management software from an Austin, Texas, company called SolarWinds. ADVERTISEMENT It\u2019s going to take months to kick elite hackers out of the U.S. government networks they have been quietly rifling through since as far back as March. Experts say there simply are not enough skilled threat-hunting teams to duly identify all the government and private-sector systems that may have been hacked. FireEye, the cybersecurity company that discovered the intrusion into U.S. agencies and was among the victims, has already tallied dozens of casualties. It\u2019s racing to identify more. Many federal workers \u2014 and others in the private sector \u2014 must presume that unclassified networks are teeming with spies. Agencies will be more inclined to conduct sensitive government business on Signal, WhatsApp and other encrypted smartphone apps. If the hackers are indeed from Russia\u2019s SVR foreign intelligence agency, as experts believe, their resistance may be tenacious. The only way to be sure a network is clean is \u201cto burn it down to the ground and rebuild it,\u201d said Bruce Schneier, a prominent security expert and Harvard fellow. Florida became the first state to acknowledge falling victim to a SolarWinds hack. Officials told The Associated Press that hackers apparently infiltrated the state\u2019s health care administration agency and others. SolarWinds\u2019 customers include most Fortune 500 companies, and its U.S. government clients are rich with generals and spymasters. ___ Associated Press writers Frank Bajak in Boston, Eric Tucker in Washington and Bobby Caina Calvan in Tallahassee, Florida, contributed to this report.",
        "summarized_context": "President Trump has downplayed the recent cyber hack of U.S. government systems and Russia's involvement, contradicting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. In a series of tweets, Trump suggested that the media exaggerated the scale of the cyberattack and questioned whether China may be responsible. Pompeo, on the other hand, stated that it was \"pretty clear\" that Russia was behind the attack. The hack, which targeted multiple agencies, has raised concerns about the security of sensitive information and the potential for disruption or destruction. Experts believe that the hackers may have been seeking nuclear secrets, advanced weaponry blueprints, COVID-19 vaccine research, and information on government and industry leaders. The scale of the hack is unprecedented, with 18,000 organizations infected by malicious code that piggybacked on popular network-management software. It is expected to take months to fully investigate and contain the breaches."

Van Drew reportedly plans to switch parties and become a Republican in the wake of the impeachment of President Donald Trump.\nDemocratic Rep. Jeff Van Drew reportedly plans to switch parties and become a Republican amid a firestorm of controversy over his opposition to impeaching President Donald Trump.\nThe conservative first-term lawmaker from South Jersey met with Trump Friday and told colleagues about his intended partisan switcheroo Saturday, Politico reported, citing several sources familiar with the decision.\nTrump will undoubtedly hail the move as a sign that the impeachment \u201choax\u201d is faltering just as the full House of Representatives prepares to vote on impeachment this coming week.\nVan Drew was one of two Democrats who opposed opening the impeachment investigation into Trump in the first place, along with Collin Peterson, D-Minn.\nAll Republicans voted against the impeachment probe, although Rep. Justin Amash, a Michigan tea party conservative, quit the party after calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\nDemocrats hope that just a handful of lawmakers will vote against impeaching Trump. Rep. Max Rose, D-N.Y., a prominent skeptic of impeachment, announced Friday that he would vote for impeachment.\nUnlike Peterson, who is a veteran lawmaker, Van Drew is a newcomer to Washington, D.C., who won his South Jersey seat in the 2018 Democratic #BlueWave midterms landslide after longtime Republican Rep. Frank Lo Biondo retired.\nA recent internal poll showed Van Drew, a conservative who has opposed gun control restrictions and same-sex marriage, was in serious trouble with Democrats in his swing district.\nJust 24% of Democratic primary voters said he should be the party\u2019s nominee, a recent poll commissioned by his own campaign found.\nIt\u2019s unlikely that Van Drew will get a cakewalk in his new party either. Several candidates were already planning to run for the GOP nod and he is likely to face stiff opposition in a district where he is well known as a Democrat, albeit an iconoclastic one.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a92019 New York Daily News\nVisit New York Daily News at www.nydailynews.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

        "context": "Rep. Jeff Van Drew. | Alex Wong/Getty Images Democratic impeachment holdout Jeff Van Drew planning to switch parties Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a moderate Democrat who is strongly opposed to impeaching President Donald Trump, is expected to switch parties and become a Republican, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation. Van Drew is one of two Democrats who voted against opening the impeachment inquiry into Trump and has remained against the effort, even as the House prepares to vote to impeach the president next week. Van Drew's decision comes after a meeting with Trump on Friday. Advertisement Van Drew\u2019s congressional, campaign staff and other members of the New Jersey delegation were informed he was planning to switch parties on Saturday, according to Democratic sources. The question now was when, not if, Van Drew was joining the Republican Party, according to several Democrats with knowledge of the ongoing conversations. As of Saturday afternoon, it was still unclear if Van Drew would make the announcement before the House votes on impeachment, which is expected Wednesday. \u201cIt was supposed to be bipartisan, it was supposed to be incontrovertible. It was supposed to be something that was always on the rarest of circumstances,\u201d Van Drew told reporters about impeachment earlier this week. \u201cWell it\u2019s not bipartisan.\u201d Republicans were excitedly touting the news on Saturday, describing it as a huge blow to Democrats' effort to impeach the president, which Trump and other GOP leaders have repeatedly decried as a \u201dpartisan witch hunt.\u201d The move is also certain to score major points with Trump, whose support could be crucial in a crowded GOP primary. Trump and Van Drew are expected to hold an event together next week, according to sources on Capitol Hill. But Democrats were already brushing off the party switch, saying Van Drew was making the calculation purely based on politics and voters would see right through his self-interested motivations in November 2020. And Democrats are quick to note that Van Drew's departure is unlikely to impact the impeachment vote tally in any way. Democratic leadership had already been expecting a handful of their members to vote against impeachment, including Van Drew, next week. Multiple senior Democrats tried to reach out to the New Jersey freshman on Saturday but were unsuccessful. Van Drew did not respond to calls and texts from POLITICO seeking comment. Rumors had swirled around Capitol Hill this week that Van Drew was considering leaving the Democratic Party but he strongly denied those claims on multiple occasions. Van Drew flipped his GOP district in southern New Jersey, helping deliver Democrats the House majority. The district, which still leans Republican, voted for Trump in 2016. The stunning move comes amid new polling commissioned by Van Drew's campaign that shows his approval ratings are under water with Democratic voters in his district. Just 24 percent of Democratic primary voters said Van Drew deserves to be reelected to Congress, and only 28 percent said he deserves to be the Democratic nominee in next year\u2019s election. TargetSmart conducted the survey from Dec. 7-10 of 390 likely Democratic primary voters, according to a source familiar with the polling. It also found 71 percent of voters would be less likely to support Van Drew in his reelection if he voted against impeachment. Only 22 percent said they would be more likely to support him. If Van Drew voted to impeach Trump, 69 percent would be more likely to back him in next year's election and 22 percent would be less likely. One Republican familiar with the situation said Saturday afternoon that the crossover was imminent. \u201cIn the works as we speak,\u201d the member said, noting that Van Drew had a meeting \u201cat length\u201d with Trump on Friday. The meeting between Trump and Van Drew was first reported by the Washington Post. Republicans on Capitol Hill had been whispering all week about whether Van Drew might join their ranks \u2014 some senior Republicans had even encouraged the move. Van Drew does not currently have any primary challengers \u2014 but Brigid Harrison, a professor at Montclair State University, had been publicly mulling a run, citing Van Drew's opposition to impeachment. He already has three GOP challengers, including businessman David Richter, who has the ability to self-fund and has already loaned his campaign $300,000. Van Drew, a dentist and former state senator whose district includes the southern portion of the state, was a long sought-after Democratic recruit. He rebuffed entreaties to run until Republican Rep. Frank LoBiondo decided to retire last cycle. Trump carried the district by 5 points in 2016. Van Drew won it by 8 points in 2018, beating Seth Grossman, an opponent whom national Republicans disavowed after discovering he had made racially insensitive comments. Local Democrats were enraged by the news. Atlantic County Democratic Chairman Michael Suleiman, whose county is entirely within the 2nd Congressional District, called Van Drew a \u201ccoward\u201d who \u201ctook the easy way out.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to vote against impeachment, but instead of owning up to his constituents and explaining to them why he\u2019s doing what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s now decided to just completely abandon the Democratic Party and switch,\u201d Suleiman said. \u201cIt\u2019s just unconscionable.\u201d Sarah Ferris, Matt Friedman and Andrew Desiderio contributed to this report.",
        "summarized_context": "Democratic Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey plans to switch parties and become a Republican, according to reports. Van Drew, who was one of two Democrats to oppose the impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump, met with Trump on Friday and informed colleagues of his decision on Saturday. Trump is likely to view Van Drew's switch as a sign that the impeachment \"hoax\" is faltering. Van Drew's move comes as the full House of Representatives prepares to vote on impeachment this week. Van Drew, a conservative who has opposed gun control and same-sex marriage, was already facing trouble with Democrats in his swing district, with just 24% of Democratic primary voters supporting him as the party's nominee, according to a recent poll. However, he is also likely to face stiff opposition within the Republican Party, as several candidates were already planning to run for the GOP nomination in his district."
