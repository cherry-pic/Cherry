event_id	factlets_cluster_id	fact	summarized_context	label2020_09_13_3	0	Story continues	Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg plans to spend at least $100 million to help Democratic nominee Joe Biden win the crucial battleground state of Florida. Bloomberg's late-stage infusion of cash reflects Democrats' concerns about the tight race in Florida, where polls show a close race and no financial advantage for President Donald Trump. Bloomberg's spending will allow the Biden campaign to invest more heavily in other key states like Pennsylvania. Even before Bloomberg's spending, both campaigns were expecting Florida to be the most expensive state in which to campaign. Trump won the state by a narrow margin in 2016, and recent polls show Biden with a slim lead. Bloomberg's money will be used for television and digital advertising, with a focus on reaching Latino voters. The move may put pressure on Republicans and the Trump campaign to spend more in Florida, leaving less money to spend elsewhere. Bloomberg, who spent $1 billion on his own failed presidential bid, has pledged to help Democrats defeat Trump regardless of his own campaign's outcome.	0

The documents, which were heavily redacted, revealed that prosecutors were investigating a “bribery-for-pardon“ scheme in which someone would offer a substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentence. The investigation also involves a “secret lobbying scheme“ in which two unidentified individuals acted as lobbyists to senior White House officials without complying with the registration requirement of the Lobbying Disclosure Act. The court documents did not name any individuals involved in the alleged schemes, and it is unclear whether President Trump is connected to the investigation.
