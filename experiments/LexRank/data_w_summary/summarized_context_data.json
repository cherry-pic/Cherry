            "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Bloomberg, who spent $1 billion of his own money on a failed 2020 presidential bid, will inject at least $100 million to help Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s campaign against President Donald Trump in Florida.\nFILE PHOTO: Former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg speaks by video feed during the 4th and final night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention, as participants from across the country are hosted over video links from the originally planned site of the convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S. August 20, 2020. 2020 Democratic National Convention/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\nThe billionaire\u2019s decision comes at a critical moment in the final 51 days of the race, with polls showing a close race in the battleground state and no financial advantage for the sitting president as voting gets under way later this month.\nTrump\u2019s initial financial supremacy over former Vice President Biden evaporated after the Republican\u2019s campaign spent freely and Democratic fundraising surged once the party\u2019s divisive primary ended.\n\u201cMike Bloomberg is committed to helping defeat Trump, and that is going to happen in the battleground states,\u201d said Bloomberg adviser Kevin Sheekey, who added that the ex-New York City mayor\u2019s spending \u201cwill mean Democrats and the Biden campaign can invest even more heavily in other key states like Pennsylvania, which will be critical to a Biden victory.\u201d\nEven before Bloomberg\u2019s spending, both campaigns were expecting Florida to be the most expensive state in which to campaign. It will be the biggest prize among competitive states on Election Day, offering 29 of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win.\nIn-state voting by mail in Florida starts on Sept. 24, and Biden is planning his first in-person visit to Florida of the general election season on Tuesday.\nTrump won the state by 113,000 votes in his victorious 2016 election, or 1.2 percentage points. He has since adopted the state as his residence and visits regularly.\nRecent polls have shown Biden with a very slim margin there, gaining ground with older voters but trailing previous Democrats\u2019 performance with Latinos. People over 65 years old make up one in five of the state\u2019s population and Latinos make up one in four.\nTrump\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee on Wednesday said they raised a combined $210 million in August, falling far short of Biden\u2019s record-breaking haul of $364.5 million for the month that included both party\u2019s televised conventions.\nThe strong fundraising may have allowed Biden to completely erase a long deficit in fundraising against Trump. Before the August fundraising tally, the Trump campaign reported having $300 million in cash on hand, compared with Biden\u2019s $294 million. Neither campaign has reported a more recent figure. The figures also do not include money being spent by outside groups.\nThe candidates have already booked $58 million in advertisements to run between last Tuesday and the Nov. 3 election, more than any other single state, according to Advertising Analytics LLC, a market data firm.\nThe Republican president, who trails Biden in national opinion polls, told reporters last week that he would spend money from his own real-estate and brand-licensing fortune, if needed.\n\u201cI thought Mini Mike was through with Democrat politics,\u201d Trump said on Twitter on Sunday. \u201cSave NYC instead.\u201d\nDemocrats had worried that Bloomberg\u2019s promised help for the party might not come through after he abandoned his own presidential primary campaign. Some were angered by Bloomberg\u2019s getting a prime-time speaking slot at the Democratic convention in August and said that his spending to date did little to advance his candidacy or the party\u2019s chances.\nA Bloomberg aide said the money would be used to help bring people to the polls who support Biden and communicating with Latino voters, in particular.\n\u201cThis will force Republicans and the Trump campaign to shift even more of their limited resources to Florida,\u201d the aide said.\nBloomberg won\u2019t be the only outside actor pouring money into the race. America First Action Inc, a group that supports Trump, said last week that it would spend $12.7 million on new ads in Florida targeting Biden.\nUnite the Country Inc, a similar group backing Biden, said last week that it is rolling out $1.4 million in targeted digital advertising aimed at persuading Latino voters in South Florida.",
            "\u00a9 Spencer Platt/Getty Images Former Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg is attempting to boost Joe Biden in Florida.\nBillionaire Mike Bloomberg announced Sunday he would spend as much as $100 million in Florida to defeat President Donald Trump in his must-win state.\nThe infusion of cash comes as polls indicate a tightening of the race between Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden, who are deadlocked in a recent Marist Poll, and as Floridians start voting by mail at the end of the month.\nBiden\u2019s support among Hispanic voters is in double digits yet remains relatively low for a Democrat who wants to carry the state according to surveys of Latinos in Florida and Miami.\nTo that end, \u201ccommunicating with Hispanic voters will be a key part\u201d of Bloomberg\u2019s effort, which will primarily focus on digital and TV ads, according to a press release issued on behalf of his Independence USA political committee.\nVote-by-mail ballots voters start going out in six days to overseas voters. For domestic voters in the United States, the ballots will start being mailed out Sept. 24. Biden plans to visit Florida on Tuesday, his first trip to the state since the coronavirus lockdowns began in March.\nFlorida also has an in-person early voting period that varies by county and begins as early as Oct. 19 and ends as late as Nov. 1, two days before Election Day.\nAs much as 75 percent of Florida\u2019s vote could be cast before Election Day and, because of the way the state tabulates votes, it could be one of the first to report its results, although the state has a history of razor-thin election margins and recounts.\nBloomberg advisers hope that his cash will help tip the state in favor of Biden, all but killing Trump\u2019s chances to win the Electoral College. Also, they say, the Florida money should help free up Democratic efforts in other states.\n\u201cBattleground states will decide this election,\u201d said a Bloomberg press release, released after a Washington Post article that first reported the news on his behalf.\n\u201cMike's substantial investment in Florida will allow Democrats and the Biden campaign to invest heavily in other key states like Pennsylvania, which will be critical to a Democratic victory,\u201d the press release said. \u201cAnd, this will force Republicans and the Trump campaign to shift even more of their limited resources to Florida.\u201d\nBoth sides are already spending big on TV in the race in Florida, where Trump, Biden and their allies have spent and reserved $319 million in ad time, according to the TV commercial tracking firm Advertising Analytics.\nVideo: Rep.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\nBillionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is planning to spend at least $100 million in the crucial battleground of Florida in support of Democratic nominee Joe Biden, a source familiar with the plans confirmed to CNN.\nLast week a NBC News/Marist College poll showed the race in a dead heat in the Sunshine State with Biden and President Donald Trump each garnering support of 48% of likely voters.\n\u201dMike Bloomberg is committed to helping defeat Trump, and that is going to happen in the battleground states. Mike's substantial investment in Florida, in addition to his contributions to the DNC and to voter protection and restoration efforts this cycle, will mean Democrats and the Biden campaign can invest even more heavily in other key states like Pennsylvania, which will be critical to a Biden victory,\u201d top Bloomberg adviser Kevin Sheekey told CNN.\nThe Washington Post, which first reported Bloomberg's expected expenditure, said the one-time Democratic presidential candidate decided to put in that large of an amount in Florida after it was reported in the New York Times and later confirmed by Trump that he is prepared to spend millions in support of his reelection effort, according to advisers.\nTrump responded to the news by insulting the former New York City mayor on his presidential campaign and debate performance. \u201dSave NYC instead,\u201d Trump tweeted.\nWith the funding news, Bloomberg's team is sending a signal to Biden and other Democrats that they can spend their money elsewhere, announcing publicly what they can't coordinate privately. The move also allows that to happen without observers seeing the Biden campaign move resources elsewhere and think they're giving up on Florida.\nOne area of concern for Democrats is Biden's current under-performing among Florida Hispanics.\nThe NBC/Marist survey showed Trump garnering 50% of the Latino vote in the state.\nWhen asked if the focus of his effort will be Latino voters, one Bloomberg adviser said. \u201dWe'll talk to every constituency important to winning FL, Latino voters clearly a focus. Will be a mix of direct spending, gifts to Democratic super Pacs, and FL political efforts already underway.\u201d\nTrump now calls Florida home and has held several events there in recent weeks.\nMany political observers consider the state a must win for Trump to have a chance at winning the election.\nBiden adviser Symone Sanders told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Sunday that the campaign knows \u201dthat we have work to do\u201d to win the support of Latino voters.\n\u201dWe have said from the beginning, and (former) Vice President Biden has been very clear about this, as has Sen. (Kamala) Harris, that we are really working to earn every single vote in this country,\u201d Sanders added. \u201dAnd we want to earn the votes of the Latino and Hispanic community, and so we're doing the work.\u201d\nShe pointed to recent events featuring both Biden and Harris in Florida and Arizona, both states with significant Latino populations, \u201dbecause we're committed to doing the work.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with comments from President Donald Trump and Biden adviser Symone Sanders.",

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is committing at least $100 million to help Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign in the crucial battleground state of Florida.\nBloomberg\u2019s late-stage infusion of cash reflects Democrats\u2019 concerns about the tight race in a state that is a priority for President Donald Trump. A victory for Biden in Florida, the largest of the perennial battleground states, would significantly complicate Trump\u2019s path to reaching the 270 Electoral College votes needed to secure a second term.\nRepublicans, however, feel confident in their chances in the state, pointing to GOP wins in 2018 and stronger-than-expected turnout in 2016 as evidence the state is trending in their direction. They\u2019ve invested millions in Florida focused on Latino outreach and boosting their field operation, and the state\u2019s size and diversity makes campaigns there expensive.\nIn a sign that Bloomberg's planned investment put Trump on alert, however, the president tweeted out his disdain for Bloomberg on Sunday morning, referencing the attacks the businessman received at a Democratic primary debate in February from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\u201dI thought Mini Mike was through with Democrat politics after spending almost 2 Billion Dollars, and then giving the worst and most inept Debate Performance in the history of Presidential Politics. Pocahontas ended his political career on first question, OVER! Save NYC instead,\u201d he tweeted.\nThe billionaire Bloomberg launched his own campaign for the Democratic nomination late last year amid worries about Biden\u2019s strengths. Despite spending $1 billion on his campaign, Bloomberg struggled and dropped out in March, quickly endorsing Biden.\nOne of the world\u2019s wealthiest men with a net worth estimated to exceed $60 billion, Bloomberg promised throughout his campaign that he would help Democrats try to defeat Trump regardless of how his own White House bid fared.\nHe exited the presidential race pledging to spend \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to defeat Trump, and has already invested millions to support Democrats up and down the ballot. Bloomberg transferred $18 million from his presidential campaign to the Democratic National Committee, and transferred its offices in six key swing states to the local Democratic parties there.\nThe businessman has contributed $500,000 to Voto Latino to help register Latino voters, $2 million to the group Collective Future to help register African American voters, and $2 million to Swing Left, a group focused on electing Democrats in swing districts. One of the groups he has founded and funds, Everytown for Gun Safety, has committed to spending $60 million on elections this cycle, and Bloomberg himself has pledged another $60 million to support Democrats in House races.\nBloomberg\u2019s new spending is intended to boost Biden before the start of early voting in Florida, which begins on Sept. 24. A Bloomberg adviser said much of the money will go to television and digital advertising. Republicans are outspending Democrats by about $8 million in the state in future television ad reservations, according to a review of Kantar/CMAG data by The Associated Press.\n___\nAP\u2019s Advance Voting guide brings you the facts about voting early, by mail or absentee from each state: https://interactives.ap.org/advance-voting-2020/",

            "\u00a9 JOHANNES EISELE/AFP/Getty Former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg speaks to supporters and staff on March 4 in New York City\nBillionaire and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg plans to spend $100 million to help Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden beat President Donald Trump in Florida, a key battleground that went for Trump in 2016.\nThe Washington Post first reported on Sunday morning that Bloomberg, a former Republican who briefly sought the Democratic presidential nomination this election cycle, had decided that spending the massive lump sum in Florida would be the best use of his money at this late stage in the campaign. Multiple recent polls suggest that Biden already has a narrow advantage in Florida, the state where Trump has officially been a resident since late 2019.\nBut Bloomberg aims to boost early voting turnout, in a bid to show a decisive Democratic victory shortly after polls close on Election Day. The spending will reportedly go largely to digital and television ads targeting Florida voters in both English and Spanish.\n\u201dVoting starts on September 24 in Florida so the need to inject real capital in that state quickly is an urgent need,\u201d Bloomberg adviser Kevin Sheekey told the Post. \u201dMike believes that by investing in Florida it will allow campaign resources and other Democratic resources to be used in other states, in particular the state of Pennsylvania.\u201d\nNewsweek reached out to the Trump and Biden campaigns for comment, but they did not respond by the time of publication. Trump tweeted his thoughts on Bloomberg's spending a few hours after the news broke on Sunday morning.\n\u201dI thought Mini Mike was through with Democrat politics after spending almost 2 Billion Dollars, and then giving the worst and most inept Debate Performance in the history of Presidential Politics. Pocahontas ended his political career on first question, OVER! Save NYC instead,\u201d the president wrote, using a racist nickname for Senator Elizabeth Warren to reference a primary debate confrontation between the two former Democratic presidential hopefuls. Trump exaggerated the amount Bloomberg spent on his brief presidential campaign.\nDuring the Democratic primaries, Bloomberg\u2014who ended up spending about $1 billion of his personal fortune on his failed presidential campaign\u2014received substantial criticism from fellow Democratic contenders. Bloomberg is worth an estimated $55 billion. They repeatedly argued that he was attempting to \u201dbuy\u201d the election, particularly as he entered the race late and decided to forego campaigning in early primary and caucus states. On March 4, after failing to win any significant support in primaries and caucuses, Bloomberg dropped out and endorsed Biden.\nTrump narrowly won Florida in 2016, after former Democratic President Barack Obama had carried the southern state in 2008 and 2012. In the last presidential election, Trump won about 49 percent of the votes in Florida compared to 47.8 percent that went for former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Obama, who Biden served under as vice president, won 50 percent of Florida's votes in 2012 and 51 percent in 2008.\nThe most recent polls out of Florida suggest that Biden already has an advantage. Separate surveys conducted this month by CNBC/Change Research and St. Pete Polls both show Biden in the lead by 3 percentage points. But an NBC News/Marist poll conducted from August 31 to September 6 showed a tied race.\nAlong with Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Democrats and Republicans see Florida and the other swing states as vital to victory in November. Current averages by RealClearPolitics show Biden leading in all four states. If the Democratic nominee manages to pull off victories in three of these states\u2014while maintaining all the states won by Democrats in the last presidential election\u2014he would be propelled to victory in the Electoral College.\nStart your unlimited Newsweek trial\nVideo: Michael Bloomberg commits to spend $100 million to help Biden in Florida (NBC News)",

Bloomberg had vowed to open up his personal fortune to help defeat Trump but his lack of financial contributions since he dropped out of the Democratic primary in March had raised eyebrows among Democrats. Now Bloomberg is finally making good on his commitment and has decided he will focus his efforts on the key state of Florida, vowing to spend at least $100 million to help Biden win the Sunshine State.\nBloomberg\u2019s commitment to spend big in the swing state known for having expensive media markets comes as polls show a tightening of the race between Trump and Biden in Florida. On Thursday, the Cook Political Report shifted the state from \u201clean Democrat\u201d to \u201ctoss up.\u201d Florida is seen as a must win for Trump if he has any hope of reaching the 270 electoral votes needed to win reelection. \u201cMike Bloomberg is committed to helping defeat Trump, and that is going to happen in the battleground states,\u201d Bloomberg senior adviser Kevin Sheekey said in a statement. \u201cMike\u2019s substantial investment in Florida, in addition to his contributions to the DNC and to voter protection and restoration efforts this cycle, will mean Democrats and the Biden campaign can invest even more heavily in other key states like Pennsylvania, which will be critical to a Biden victory.\u201d\nBiden plans to visit Florida on Tuesday in what will be his first trip to the state since the coronavirus lockdowns began in March.

It is considered one of the Web\u2019s foundational laws, crafted in large part to facilitate free expression digitally.\nMany lawmakers \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 increasingly have come to question whether the protections are outdated, conferring legal immunity on tech giants at a time when they have failed to crack down on hate speech, election disinformation and other harmful content online. But Trump and his Republican allies have seized on the debate to advance their arguments that Facebook, Google, Twitter and others should be penalized for exhibiting systemic political bias against conservatives \u2014 a charge for which they have provided scant evidence, and one that tech giants long have denied.\nTrump has stepped up his attacks in recent months, particularly as social media companies have taken more aggressive action against his most controversial online posts \u2014 including his tweets falsely claiming he won the 2020 presidential election. Earlier this year, the president also signed a sweeping executive order that sought to give the government vast new power to police political speech on the Web, a directive later challenged in court over its constitutionality. And Trump has repeatedly urged state and federal investigators to use their broad investigatory powers to probe, and potentially punish, Silicon Valley over allegations of bias.\nSection 230 otherwise has no nexus with national security. A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment late Tuesday about the president\u2019s contention that the law puts the country at risk.\nTrump\u2019s ultimatum arrives after he previously threatened to veto the roughly $740 billion defense bill, known as the NDAA, over a provision that would require the Pentagon to change the names of 10 military installations that recognize Confederate military officers who fought to preserve slavery. Trump has said he will not allow that to happen, and he grew angry when defense officials said that Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, whom Trump has since fired, and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy had signaled openness to the bases being renamed.\nSen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told The Washington Post in an interview last month that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has a policy against putting bills on the floor for a vote when they have a veto threat.\nBut some Republicans in recent days have suggested a trade: Reforming Section 230 in exchange for the base-name changes that Democrats seek, according to a person familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to describe the private conversations.

            "PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday granted pardons to former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former adviser Roger Stone, sweeping away the most important convictions under the long-running Russia election probe.\nTrump also issued a pardon for Charles Kushner, a real estate developer and the father of Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\nTrump, taking advantage of a right granted by the Constitution only to the president, has issued two groups of pardons in as many days, and more are anticipated as Trump faces the end of his presidency on Jan. 20.\nThe announcement came just after Trump arrived in Palm Beach, Florida, for the holiday season, with Jared Kushner on the Air Force One flight with him.\nIn total, Trump issued on Wednesday pardons to 26 individuals and commuted part or all of the sentences of an additional three people. A commutation removes the punishment but leaves the conviction in place.\nOf special interest for Trump has been attacking the results of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign, a case Trump repeatedly dismissed as a political witch hunt.\nReacting to Wednesday\u2019s pardons, Republican Senator Ben Sasse, in a six-word statement, said: \u201cThis is rotten to the core.\u201d\nBesides Manafort and Stone, Trump has pardoned two other major figures from the Russia probe, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former adviser George Papadopoulos.\nThe Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, which has been trying to prosecute Manafort in New York for mortgage fraud and other alleged crimes, said it would continue to pursue an appeal for its case, which was dismissed on double jeopardy grounds.\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\n\u201cThis action underscores the urgent need to hold Mr. Manafort accountable for his crimes against the People of New York as alleged in our indictment, and we will continue to pursue our appellate remedies,\u201d said Danny Frost, spokesman for the office.\nFIGURES IN RUSSIA INVESTIGATION\nThe Manafort pardon spared the long-time Republican operative from serving the bulk of his 7-1/2-year prison term.\nManafort, 70, was among the first in Trump\u2019s inner circle to face charges brought by Mueller as part of his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\nManafort worked on Trump\u2019s White House campaign for five months in 2016. In 2018, Trump called him a \u201cbrave man\u201d for not cooperating with federal authorities.\nEvidence from the Russia investigation indicated that Trump intended to encourage Manafort \u201cnot to cooperate with the government,\u201d according to Mueller\u2019s report.\nIn a statement relayed by his lawyer, Manafort expressed his appreciation to Trump.\n\u201cMr. President, my family & I humbly thank you for the Presidential Pardon you bestowed on me. Words cannot fully convey how grateful we are,\u201d he said.\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\nAndrew Weissmann, a top Mueller deputy who oversaw Manafort\u2019s prosecution by the special counsel, noted that Manafort has served roughly two years of his sentence, and that assets seized in civil forfeiture proceedings would fall outside the pardon.\n\u201cSo, there still are consequences to Paul Manafort, they are just not commensurate with the extensive criminality that he was convicted of and plead guilty to,\u201d Weissmann said on CNN.\nStone was convicted in November 2019 by a Washington jury of lying under oath to lawmakers also investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nTrump commuted his sentence in July, a day before Stone was due to begin serving a term of three years and four months. Stone, in a statement, thanked Trump for \u201ccompletely erasing the criminal conviction to which I was subjected in a Soviet-style show trial on politically-motivated charges.\u201d\nCharles Kushner was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty in 2004 to 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering and making unlawful campaign donations.\nIn an unusual twist, the man who prosecuted Charles Kushner was Chris Christie, now the former governor of New Jersey, who also has served as an adviser to Trump.\nChristie was quoted by CNN as saying Charles Kushner\u2019s case was \u201cone of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes\u201d he prosecuted.\nDuring the case, Charles Kushner admitted to smearing his brother-in-law, who had cooperated with prosecutors, by hiring a prostitute to have sex with him in a motel room, then sending a secretly recorded video of the encounter to the man\u2019s wife, Charles Kushner\u2019s own sister.\nA pardon in practice grants full legal forgiveness for a federal crime, as a result removing any remaining prison sentence, probation conditions or unpaid fines. It also relieves the person of the potential consequences of a felony conviction, such as being barred from voting, running for public office and owning a gun.",
            "President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that he\u2019s granted yet another spate of pardons to 26 people, including his friend and confidant Roger Stone, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Charles Kushner, father of Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared. Trump also gave sentence commutations to three people.\nThe move comes just a day after the president announced his decision to pardon or commute the sentences of 20 people, including three corrupt former Republican congressmen, two subjects of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and four Blackwater security guards who were involved in the 2007 killings of Iraqi civilians.\nIn a Wednesday statement, the White House said Stone and Manafort \u2015 both of whom were indicted in the Mueller probe as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2015 had been victims of \u201cperhaps the greatest witch hunt in American history.\u201d\nStone was sentenced in February to 40 months in prison for multiple felonies, including witness tampering, lying to Congress and obstructing the House investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in 2016.\nTrump commuted Stone\u2019s sentence in July \u2015 prompting a harsh rebuke from Mueller.\n\u201cStone was prosecuted and convicted because he committed federal crimes. He remains a convicted felon, and rightly so,\u201d the special counsel wrote in an op-ed at the time.",

The Manafort pardon was the latest in a series given to former aides caught up in that investigation \u2013 and underscored the president's desire to deal with the fallout of that probe.\n\u00a9 TIMOTHY A. CLARY, AFP via Getty Images President Trump's one-time campaign manager Paul Manafort arrives at Manhattan Supreme Court on June 27, 2019 for his arraignment on mortgage fraud charges. The longtime Republican political consultant, 71, was sentenced last year to seven and a half years in jail for tax crimes, bank fraud and conspiracy charges, mostly relating to his business dealings in Ukraine with Russia-allied politicians and tycoons. Manafort was released to home confinement in May due to the risk posed by the spread of the coronavirus in federal prison.\nOn the heels of another round of clemency just a day earlier, Trump granted pardons to 26 people on Wednesday and commuted part or all of the sentences of three more people. The move followed a tradition of presidents granting pardons \u2013 often controversial \u2013 during their remaining days in the White House.\nStart the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.\nManafort's pardon came as part of the latest batch of clemency grants which also included Charles Kushner, the father of Jared Kushner, who is the president's son-in-law and senior advisor. Charles Kushner was convicted of preparing false tax returns, witness retaliation, and making false statements to the FEC.\nTrump also granted a pardon Wednesday to Roger Stone, a Republican operative convicted of lying to Congress to protect the president's campaign from an investigation into Russian election interference. Trump had commuted Stone's sentence in July.\nOnce again, the grants drew sharp rebukes from critics and prosecutors who described the moves as an effort to invalidate special counsel Robert Mueller's two-year investigation into Russian election interference in 2016.\nThe president's opponents said the list reflects Trump's habit of granting pardons to political allies or to people who could have testified against him during the Russia investigation.\n\u201dIn pardoning Paul Manafort, Roger Stone and Charles Kushner, President Trump has made it clear that he believes the purpose of the pardon is to bail out rich white men connected to him,\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \u201dTrump has turned an instrument of mercy and justice into just another way for him to be corrupt.\u201d\nRep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, agreed.\n\u201dPardons for Paul Manafort and Roger Stone serve neither justice nor mercy,\u201d Nadler said. \u201dPresident Trump is handing out rewards to his co-conspirators and shielding his own conduct from scrutiny.\u201d\nManafort thanked Trump with a post on Twitter.\n\u201dMr. President, my family & I humbly thank you for the Presidential Pardon you bestowed on me. Words cannot fully convey how grateful we are,\u201d he wrote.\nManafort was sentenced to nearly four years in prison in Virginia, where he was convicted of defrauding banks and taxpayers out of millions of dollars he had amassed through illicit lobbying. He was sentenced to a little over three years in prison in Washington, D.C., where he pleaded guilty.\nUnraveling Mueller\nThe Manafort pardon was yet another move by the president to roll back the nearly two-year investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. A day earlier, Trump granted a pardon to George Papadopoulos, a former campaign aide who admitted lying to the FBI as part of that investigation.\nHe also pardoned Alex van der Zwaan on Tuesday. The Dutch attorney pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his work with two of Trump's former campaign aides.\nTrump pardoned his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, in November, ending a three-year legal odyssey for the retired Army general who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian ambassador before Trump's inauguration in 2017.\nU.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson \u2013 who presided over the criminal case of Roger Stone, another Trump ally \u2013 delivered a withering rebuke from the bench during Manafort's sentencing in Washington. She said that Manafort spent much of his career \u201dgaming the system\u201d and that he cheated taxpayers to maintain an extravagant lifestyle.\n\u201dIt's hard to overstate the number of lies and the amount of fraud and the extraordinary amount of money involved,\u201d Jackson said.\nTrump said after Manafort was sentenced that he felt \u201dvery badly\u201d for his former campaign chairman. \u201dIt's a very sad situation,\u201d he told reporters.\n'Counterintelligence threat'\nA voluminous report released last summer by the GOP-led Senate Intelligence Committee found that Manafort's role as Trump campaign chairman, his longstanding ties to people affiliated with Russian intelligence services and his willingness to share information with them \u201drepresented a grave counterintelligence threat\u201d during the 2016 presidential race.\n'Counterintelligence threat': Republican-led Senate panel singles out former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort\nManafort to serve time at home: Ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort released from prison amid coronavirus pandemic\n\u201dThe Committee found that Manafort's presence on the Campaign and proximity to Trump created opportunities for Russian intelligence services to exert influence over and acquire confidential information on, the Trump campaign,\u201d according to the nearly 1,000-page report.\nManafort, 71, has been serving his sentence in his home in Northern Virginia after the Bureau of Prisons moved him to home confinement as the coronavirus pandemic spread in the federal corrections system.\nHis attorneys asked prison officials to allow him to serve the rest of his sentence at home, saying his old age and health conditions put him at \u201dhigh risk\u201d of COVID-19 infection. They said Manafort suffers from several health conditions, including high blood pressure, liver disease and respiratory illness, and he was hospitalized for a heart condition, flu and bronchitis while in prison.\nTrump has also granted clemency to longtime ally Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress to protect Trump and his campaign from the Russia investigation. The president commuted Stone's 40-month sentence just days before he was set to report to prison last summer.\nJohnson influence\nAlice Johnson, who was pardoned by Trump in August, appeared to be behind several of the individuals the president granted clemency to on Wednesday.\nTopeka Sam served three years of a 130-month sentence in 2012 as a result of pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine. Sam founded a group to help incarcerated women transition back into society and helped the passage of the First Step Act that Trump signed into law in 2018.\nThe White House said Johnson was also behind Trump's pardon of James Batmasian, who pled guilty to willful failure to collect and remit payroll taxes.

            "\u00a9 Provided by The Daily Beast Timothy A. Clary/AFP via Getty\nIn a move that surprised precious few, President Donald Trump issued another flurry of pardons on Wednesday night, including a full pardon for his son-in-law's father, Charles Kushner, and Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman who was found guilty of tax and bank fraud and later pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct justice after lying to investigators looking into Russian election interference.\nKushner, 66, was released from prison in 2006 after serving two years for a conviction of tax evasion and witness tampering.\nManafort is the latest member of Trump\u2019s inner circle to be pardoned by the outgoing president, who has appeared determined to cause as much shock and confusion as he can before he leaves office on Jan. 20. He has not yet conceded defeat in an election he lost by more than 7 million votes and has repeatedly insisted he has a shot at a second term, despite the Electoral College officially affirming President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory.\nTrump has already embarked upon a pardon spree that saw him grant clemency to many of his former aides and allies, including Michael Flynn, his first national security adviser who pleaded guilty\u2014twice\u2014to lying to the FBI, shortly before Thanksgiving. On Dec. 22, Trump pardoned a slew of others, including former campaign aide George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team during the Russia probe; former U.S. congressman Duncan Hunter, who was convicted of stealing more than $200,000 in campaign donations; and four Blackwater mercenaries found guilty of slaughtering more than a dozen Iraqi civilians in 2014.\nTrump is reportedly considering further pardons on his way out the door, and is said to have discussed pardoning not only members of his family to head off any possible future prosecutions, but also himself. While virtually all U.S. presidents from both parties have granted pardons and sentence commutations before stepping down, Trump has been stunningly brazen about using his pardon powers to help friends and repay associates he sees as having been personally loyal.\nManafort, 71, was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years but in May was given permission to serve the remainder of his term in home confinement due to COVID-19 fears in prison.\nHis myriad financial crimes afforded him an opulent lifestyle. In court, federal prosecutors described a wardrobe worth more than $1 million, which included a $15,000 jacket made from ostrich leather.\nOver the course of several years, which overlapped in part with his running of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, Manafort made millions advising Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a pro-Russian politician ousted from office in 2014. When questioned by Mueller\u2019s investigators about his years of undisclosed work in Ukraine, as well as his association with Kremlin-linked political operative Konstantin Kilimnik, Manafort at first stonewalled, then \u201cintentionally provided false information,\u201d according to prosecutors.\nAt his 2019 sentencing on the obstruction charges, which added 43 months to the four years handed down for the financial fraud, Manafort told Judge Amy Berman Jackson, \u201cI am sorry for what I\u2019ve done. Let me be very clear, I accept the responsibility for the acts that caused me to be here today.\u201d\nAlthough Jackson said she didn\u2019t doubt Manafort\u2019s sincerity, she was largely unmoved.\n\u201cIt is hard to overstate the number of lies and the amount of fraud and the extraordinary amount of money involved,\u201d she told him, adding, \u201cSaying \u2018I\u2019m sorry I got caught\u2019 is not an inspiring plea for leniency.\u201d\nAllies of Manafort are said to have been keeping their fingers crossed for a pardon, which to many seemed inevitable in light of Trump\u2019s frequent praise of his former campaign chairman. Trump had repeatedly praised \u201cbrave\u201d Manafort for \u201crefusing to break\u201d and cooperate with investigators like his former fixer Michael Cohen did.\nAndrew Weissmann, who served as one of Mueller\u2019s deputies during the Russia investigation, has blasted Trump for abusing the pardon system. Manafort was incentivized not to cooperate with the Mueller team because he sensed Trump would later pardon him if he were punished, Weissmann told NPR.\nAs his White House departure nears, Trump is reportedly fielding countless requests from hopeful pardon-seekers. Those looking to be let off the hook for past crimes reportedly include Joe Exotic, the incarcerated \u201cTiger King\u201d star, and former Trump campaign adviser Rick Gates, who pleaded guilty to financial fraud and lying to investigators during the Russia probe. Former Trump campaign strategist Steve Bannon, who was indicted by a grand jury in New York for financial fraud, is also thought to be among the contenders for a potential pardon. Trump is also said to have weighed granting preemptive pardons to some of his own family members facing legal scrutiny, as well as his lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\nAlthough Manafort was one of Trump\u2019s closest confidants, not everyone pardoned by Trump has been a close confidant. Alfred Lee Crum, who pleaded guilty in 1952 to illegally making moonshine at the age of 19, was granted a pardon earlier this week. His punishment was significantly lighter than the one handed down to Manafort: three years of probation and a $250 fine.\nRead more at The Daily Beast.",
            "\u00a9 Tom Brenner/Reuters President Trump waves as he boards Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Wednesday.\nPresident Trump on Wednesday granted pardons or other clemency to another 29 people, including real estate developer Charles Kushner, his son-in-law\u2019s father, and two former advisers who were convicted as part of the FBI\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2014 once again using his executive power to benefit his allies and undermine an investigation that dogged his presidency.\nWith his time in office nearing its end, Trump pardoned former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was convicted in 2018 of committing financial fraud and conspiring to obstruct the investigation of his crimes, and he upgraded to a full pardon the sentence commutation he provided earlier to longtime friend Roger Stone.\nTrump also pardoned Kushner, the father of Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, who pleaded guilty in 2004 to having made false statements to the Federal Election Commission, and he subsequently pleaded guilty to witness tampering, and tax evasion stemming from $6 million in political contributions and gifts mischaracterized as business expenses.\nThe move came just a day after Trump granted commutations or pardons to 20 people, including three former Republican members of Congress and two others who were convicted of crimes as part of the investigation into Russia\u2019s activities four years ago. The president also pardoned military contractors involved in the killing of unarmed civilians during the Iraq War. Routinely, Trump has avoided the normal Justice Department process for pardons, instead granting clemency to political allies and the well-connected.\nWednesday\u2019s announcement is unlikely to be the last batch of clemency the president unleashes. Trump has told aides, advisers, allies, lawmakers and others to bring him names for consideration, according to two people who have spoken to him. Like others, they spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\u201cHe wants to pardon people,\u201d one of these people said. \u201cIf you have someone, now is the time.\u201d\nThe move sparked blowback, mostly from Democrats, who accused him of wielding his executive authority to shield himself from possible criminal investigation.\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) called for eliminating the presidential pardon power.\n\u201cOnce one party allows the pardon power to become a tool of criminal enterprise, its danger to democracy outweighs its utility as an instrument of justice,\u201d Murphy tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s time to remove the pardon power from the Constitution.\u201d\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said, \u201cThis is rotten to the core.\u201d\n\u00a9 Provided by The Washington Post\n\u00a9 Provided by The Washington Post\nWith Wednesday\u2019s pardon of Manafort, Trump has now intervened to aid five people charged in the Russia probe, which was eventually taken over by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. The White House announcement made no secret that Trump was taking aim at that investigation; it said Manfort\u2019s convictions were \u201cpremised on the Russian collusion hoax,\u201d and that the pardon for Stone would \u201chelp to right the injustices he faced at the hands of the Mueller investigation.\u201d\nGrant Smith, a Stone attorney, said in a statement: \u201cWhen the paperwork arrives from the Department of Justice, Mr. Stone will promptly sign the acceptance of the Presidential Pardon. He is humbled that President Trump used his Constitutional power to allow Mr. & Mrs. Stone to put this behind them and move on with their lives.\u201d\nStone himself issued a lengthy statement attacking the case and thanking Trump for \u201chis extraordinary act of justice.\u201d\nA Twitter account for Manafort, which appears to have been dormant for years, posted Wednesday night, \u201cMr. President, my family & I humbly thank you for the Presidential Pardon you bestowed on me. Words cannot fully convey how grateful we are. \u2026 You truly did \u2018Make America Great Again.\u2019 God Bless you & your family. I wish you a Merry Christmas & many good wishes for the coming years.\u201d\nIn November, Trump pardoned former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his dealings with the Russian ambassador to the United States, though he later sought to take it back. In July, he commuted the sentence for Stone, who was convicted of seeking to impede a congressional investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and sentenced to 40 months in prison. And on Tuesday, he pardoned George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to his 2016 campaign who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during its Russia investigation, and Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch lawyer who pleaded guilty in 2018 to lying to Mueller\u2019s team.\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) tweeted, \u201cPardons for Paul Manafort and Roger Stone serve neither justice nor mercy. President Trump is handing out rewards to his co-conspirators and shielding his own conduct from scrutiny.\u201d\nThe list of those pardoned Wednesday was eclectic, and included a former congressman convicted of acting as a foreign agent, a Prince George\u2019s County, Md., police officer convicted of releasing her police dog to attack a man who had surrendered, and a Border Patrol agent who kicked and punched suspects whom he took into custody after a chase. On Tuesday, Trump pardoned former Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.), who pleaded guilty to using campaign funds on personal matters. On Wednesday, he pardoned Hunter\u2019s wife, Margaret, who pleaded guilty in the case before her husband and agreed to cooperate.\nTrump has drawn significant criticism for how he has used his pardon power, though one adviser said the president is unconcerned about the blowback.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just burning it all down,\u201d this person said. The adviser said the president has also discussed pardoning Stephen K. Bannon, his former chief strategist, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer, and will issue dozens more before he leaves office.\nTrump flew to his resort at Mar-a-Lago Wednesday, where he was greeted by hundreds of supporters along his motorcade route. The mostly unmasked supporters waved Trump flags and signs and chanted \u201cFour more years!\u201d One small boy had a sign that said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to miss you.\u201d\nThe practical effect of Trump\u2019s latest move was particularly significant for Manafort, who had been facing a 7 1/ 2 -year federal prison sentence, though he was released to home confinement in May, about two years in, over dangers posed by the coronavirus pandemic. Manafort was found guilty in federal court in Virginia in 2018 of stashing the money he made as a lobbyist from Ukrainian oligarchs overseas to avoid taxes and then committing bank fraud to keep up a lavish lifestyle when his patrons lost power. He then pleaded guilty to related charges in federal court in D.C. and pledged to cooperate with the special counsel, but a judge concluded that he lied to investigators, notably about his interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik, a longtime Manafort aide assessed by the FBI to have ties to Russian intelligence.\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Manafort gave Kilimnik internal Trump campaign polling data; Mueller\u2019s investigators said they were never able to determine how Kilimnik used the information.\nManafort could still face legal jeopardy from state authorities in New York, which would be outside the reach of a presidential pardon, though so far authorities there have faced an uphill battle.\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance had sought to bring a mortgage fraud case against Manafort after his federal convictions, but a court dismissed it on double jeopardy grounds. Vance, though, has been taking steps to revive the effort, and Danny Frost, a spokesman for his office, said in a statement Wednesday, \u201cThis action underscores the urgent need to hold Mr. Manafort accountable for his crimes against the People of New York as alleged in our indictment, and we will continue to pursue our appellate remedies.\u201d\n\u00a9 Marko Georgiev/AP In this 2005 file photo, Charles B. Kushner, flanked by his wife, Seryl Beth, left, and his attorney Alfred DeCotiis arrives at the Newark federal court in New Jersey.\nCharles Kushner, who was sentenced to two years in prison, already had served his time. Among the allegations brought by prosecutors were that he paid for an unnamed individual\u2019s private school tuition out of company accounts and declared the payments as charitable contributions on his tax returns, according to court documents. The White House cited campaign adviser Matt Schlapp\u2019s support of Charles Kushner\u2019s pardon, along with the support of a former U.S. attorney in Utah.\nUpon his release, Charles Kushner resumed practicing real estate development, and his New Jersey-based firm manages more than 20,000 apartments in New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia and Tennessee.\nJared Kushner, husband of Ivanka Trump, has long held that the prosecution against his father, led by then-U.S. Attorney Chris Christie, was unjust, despite his father\u2019s guilty pleas. Trump has not spoken to the former New Jersey governor in several weeks, a person familiar with their relationship said, and Christie has repeatedly encouraged the president publicly to stop trying to overturn the election. Christie had no comment.\nAccording to court documents, while Charles Kushner was under investigation for campaign contributions, he grew angry when he learned that other family members were cooperating with the probe. He paid a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law in a New Jersey motel room, where hidden cameras had been set, and later had the tape mailed to his sister as a warning, according to the documents.\nThe conviction changed Jared Kushner\u2019s trajectory, he later said, from his goal of becoming a prosecutor. \u201cSeeing my father\u2019s situation, I felt what happened was obviously unjust in terms of the way they pursued him,\u201d he told a real estate magazine, the Real Deal, in 2014. \u201cI just never wanted to be on the other side of that and cause pain to the families I was doing that to, whether right or wrong.\u201d\nJared Kushner\u2019s continued ownership stake in his family\u2019s business while working in the White House repeatedly raised concerns among ethics officials and experts, particularly when the Kushner Cos. was seeking buyers and lenders for its money-losing project at 666 Fifth Avenue in New York. Brookfield Properties took over the property from the Kushners in 2018 and renamed it 660 Fifth.\nCharles Kushner told the New York Times in 2018 that he would \u201cprefer not to have a pardon\u201d because of the publicity it would generate.\nTrump also pardoned former GOP congressman Mark Siljander of Michigan who in 2010 pleaded guilty to charges of obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent on behalf of an Islamic charity that hired Siljander to lobby Congress to have its name removed from a list of alleged terrorist-supporting organizations. In 2012, Siljander was sentenced to a year in federal prison.\nTrump similarly pardoned Stephanie Mohr, a former Maryland police officer who served 10 years in federal prison for allowing her police dog to bite and restrain a burglary suspect in 1995. The bite wound required 10 stitches on the calf of the suspect, an unarmed homeless man. A federal jury convicted Mohr, then 30, of violating his civil rights by releasing her police dog to attack him.\nTrump also pardoned Gary Brugman, a former Border Patrol agent who spent 27 months in federal prison for assaulting a Mexican national who illegally crossed the U.S. border into Texas. A federal jury convicted Brugman of violating the man\u2019s civil rights.\nAnd he pardoned Jesse Benton, a former aide to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who backed the pardon. Benton was convicted of an attempt to buy an endorsement for Ron Paul\u2019s 2012 presidential bid. Benton had worked for a PAC affiliated with Trump but resigned after the charges were filed.\nRachel Weiner contributed to this report.",

A guide to the key figures\nIn total, Trump pardoned or issued commutations to 29 people on Wednesday, including Margaret Hunter, the wife of Duncan Hunter, the former Republican representative of California, who was pardoned yesterday.\nTrump\u2019s latest set of pre-Christmas pardons follows a brazen round of pardons and commutations granted on Tuesday. The president issued 15 pardons and five commutations to allies, including two figures who plead guilty in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry on Russian interference in the 2016 US elections.\nOn Tuesday, the president pardoned George Papadopoulos, a former adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to federal officials during the Russia investigation, and Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch lawyer and son-in-law of the Russian billionaire German Khan. Van der Zwaan had pleaded guilty to similar charges.\n\u00a9 Provided by The Guardian Charles Kushner, center, arrives at the Newark federal court for sentencing in 2005. Photograph: Marko Georgiev/AP\nPapadopoulos and Van der Zwaan were the third and fourth people pardoned for charges in connection to the Russia inquiry. In November, Trump pardoned his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about contacts with a Russian official. The president, who has long derided the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election as a \u201choax\u201d, has been expected to dole out pardons to those implicated in the inquiry.\nTuesday\u2019s rash of pardons was also bestowed upon four former Blackwater contractors who were convicted on charges related to a 2007 massacre in Iraq. The four men, part of a security convoy, fired indiscriminately at civilians, killing 14 people \u2013 including a nine-year-old child. The move drew harsh criticism, including from the families of those who were killed. Adil al-Khazali, whose father Ali was killed in the attack, said in response: \u201cJustice doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\nUnder the US constitution, the president has broad, unilateral pardon powers, but pardons are traditionally reviewed by the justice department. Many of Trump\u2019s pardons, however, seem to clash with department standards \u2013 and are instead bestowed as a means to reward allies or act on grudges. Only five of 65 pardons and commutations Trump issued before Wednesday were recommended by the justice department pardon attorney, according to a tally by the Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith.\nManafort, 71, was sentenced for convictions including unregistered lobbying, tax fraud, bank fraud and money laundering. Stone, 68, was convicted of lying to Congress and obstructing a congressional investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election. \u201cMr President, my family & I humbly thank you for the Presidential Pardon you bestowed on me. Words cannot fully convey how grateful we are,\u201d Manafort tweeted on Wednesday night.\n\u00a9 Provided by The Guardian Wednesday\u2019s 26 pardons followed 15 pardons and five commutations on Tuesday. Photograph: Joshua Roberts/Getty Images\nA presidential pardon does not shield someone from state charges, and the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr, is still looking to prosecute Manafort for state crimes. Trump\u2019s pardon \u201cunderscores the urgent need to hold Mr Manafort accountable for his crimes against the People of New York as alleged in our indictment, and we will continue to pursue our appellate remedies\u201d, Danny Frost, a spokesman for Vance, told CNBC. A judge had previously blocked Vance from advancing his case, to protect Manafort from being prosecuted twice for the same crimes.\nA Trump lawyer reportedly offered pardons to Manafort and Flynn as they were approached by federal investigators \u2013 raising suspicions that the pardons were proffered in exchange for loyalty to Trump. The New York Times first reported the news in 2018. In his report following the investigation, Mueller wrote: \u201cMany of the president\u2019s acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons, occurred in public view.\u201d\nAdam Schiff, the Democratic representative of California who prosecuted the impeachment trial of Trump, said: \u201cDuring the Mueller investigation, Trump\u2019s lawyer floated a pardon to Manafort. Manafort withdrew his cooperation with prosecutors, lied, was convicted, and then Trump praised him for not \u2018ratting\u2019.

Those who lie, cheat or steal for him and his family,\u201d Schiff said.\nCharles Kushner, 66, pleaded guilty to tax evasion and lying to the Federal Election Commission. He also pleaded guilty to witness tampering, after he retaliated against his brother-in-law William Schulder, who was cooperating with federal investigators. Kushner was accused of hiring a sex worker to seduce Schulder, videotaping the encounter and sending the tape to Schulder\u2019s wife \u2013 Kushner\u2019s sister.\nAnother twist: Kushner was prosecuted by Chris Christie, a former US attorney and New Jersey governor who has been a Trump loyalist.\nThe executive director of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, said: \u201cIn pardoning Paul Manafort, Roger Stone and Charles Kushner, President Trump has made it clear that he believes the purpose of the pardon is to bail out rich white men connected to him.

In 2018, Trump called him a \u201cbrave man\u201d for not cooperating with federal authorities.\nEvidence from the Russia investigation indicated that Trump intended to encourage Manafort \u201cnot to cooperate with the government,\u201d according to Mueller\u2019s report.\nIn a statement relayed by his lawyer, Manafort expressed his appreciation to Trump.\n\u201dMr. President, my family & I humbly thank you for the Presidential Pardon you bestowed on me.

Clary/AFP/Getty Images President Trump's one-time campaign manager Paul Manafort arrives at Manhattan Supreme Court June 27, 2019 for his arraignment on mortgage fraud charges.\n(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump pardoned his 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort, using his executive power in the final weeks as president to free an ally who\u2019d been convicted of financial crimes and illegal lobbying.\nTrump also pardoned Roger Stone, a longtime political adviser whose sentence for a conviction of lying to Congress he had previously commuted; and Charles Kushner, the real estate developer and father of the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\nThe White House announced the pardons on Wednesday night after Trump arrived at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for the holidays.\nThe clemency drew sharp criticism from members of both parties. Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican and sometime opponent of the president, released a brief statement with the sentence: \u201cThis is rotten to the core.\u201d\nJust the night before, the president announced pardons of many other people, including two men convicted as part of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and two former Republican congressmen convicted of a range of financial crimes.\nManafort, an international political consultant and Republican Party operative, was serving a 7 1/2-year term when he was released in May to home confinement due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nHe was convicted in August 2018 of lying to tax authorities about tens of millions of dollars he earned as a political consultant in Ukraine and misleading banks about his financial health to get loans.\nHis conviction also came about as part of Mueller\u2019s inquiry into the 2016 election.\nWhy Presidential Pardons Are Normal, Trump\u2019s Less So: QuickTake\nManafort later pleaded guilty to conspiring to lobby illegally for Ukraine, to laundering money to support a lavish lifestyle and tampering with witnesses.\nTrump had previously resisted offering Manafort a pardon, likely in part because doing so posed a political risk. His decision to move forward now appeared at least a tacit acknowledgment that his presidency is nearing an end, despite asserting without evidence that he was robbed of a victory by widespread election fraud.\nShortly after Manafort\u2019s conviction, Trump told reporters he believed Manafort was a \u201cgood man\u201d and said he felt \u201cvery sad\u201d about the conviction -- even though the crimes did not relate to the president. Trump went on to suggest that Manafort had been unfairly targeted by federal investigators.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a witch hunt and it\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d Trump said.\nManafort was also indicted in New York for lying on mortgage applications for properties in Manhattan and Brooklyn.\nBut in October an appeals court there upheld an earlier dismissal of the charges, finding state law didn\u2019t allow for prosecution of the same charges as Manafort faced at the federal level. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. has appealed that decision.\nDanny Frost, a spokesman for Vance, said Trump\u2019s pardon \u201cunderscores the urgent need to hold Mr. Manafort accountable for his crimes against the people of New York as alleged in our indictment, and we will continue to pursue our appellate remedies.\u201d\nEarlier: Trump Pardons Former Campaign Aide, Two Former GOP Lawmakers\nThe elder Kushner was imprisoned after being convicted of charges that included preparing false tax returns and witness retaliation. He was prosecuted by Chris Christie, then a U.S. attorney in New Jersey, who later became the state\u2019s governor and, eventually, an adviser to Trump.\nMoments after the pardon was announced, Stone\u2019s lawyer Grant Smith said his client is \u201chumbled that President Trump used his Constitutional power to allow Mr. & Mrs. Stone to put this behind them and move on with their lives.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Trump announced pardons of former campaign aide George Papadopoulos, who was convicted of lying to the FBI, and Alex van der Zwaan, a lawyer who was also convicted of making false statements during the Russia investigation. He also pardoned four men who worked as security guards for Blackwater and had been convicted in relation to the 2007 killing of Iraqi civilians.\nThe former congressmen pardoned include Duncan Hunter, the California lawmaker who pleaded guilty to misusing campaign funds, and Chris Collins, a representative from New York who pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to commit securities fraud. The president also commuted the remaining prison sentence of Steve Stockman, a former congressman from Texas who was convicted of misusing charitable funds.\nOn Wednesday, Trump pardoned yet another former congressman, Mark Siljander, a Republican who represented a district in Michigan until 1987. In 2010, he pleaded guilty to obstructing justice and acting as an unregistered foreign agent.\nEarlier this month, Trump pardoned Michael Flynn, his first national security adviser, who pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents, and commuted the sentence of Stone, who was supposed to serve more than three years in prison for witness tampering and lying to Congress.\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, criticized the pardons on Twitter.\nAnd Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who led the impeachment investigation of Trump, accused him of corrupting the presidential powers of clemency.\n\u201cTrump is doling out pardons, not on the basis of repentance, restitution or the interests of justice,\u201d Schiff said in a statement, \u201cbut to reward his friends and political allies, to protect those who lie to cover up him, to shelter those guilty of killing civilians, and to undermine an investigation that uncovered massive wrongdoing.\u201d\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, a legal advocacy group, said \u201cTrump has made it clear that he believes the purpose of the pardon is to bail out rich White men connected to him. Trump has turned an instrument of mercy and justice into just another way for him to be corrupt.\u201d\n(Updates with reaction, starting in fourth paragraph.)\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.",
            "With his time in office nearing its end, Trump pardoned former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was convicted in 2018 of committing financial fraud and conspiring to obstruct the investigation of his crimes, and he upgraded to a full pardon the sentence commutation he provided earlier to longtime friend Roger Stone.\nTrump also pardoned Kushner, the father of Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, who pleaded guilty in 2004 to having made false statements to the Federal Election Commission, and he subsequently pleaded guilty to witness tampering, and tax evasion stemming from $6 million in political contributions and gifts mischaracterized as business expenses.\nAt the end of most presidencies, one of the last things a president does is issue pardons. Will President Trump attempt to pardon himself and his family? (The Washington Post)\nThe move came just a day after Trump granted commutations or pardons to 20 people, including three former Republican members of Congress and two others who were convicted of crimes as part of the investigation into Russia\u2019s activities four years ago. The president also pardoned military contractors involved in the killing of unarmed civilians during the Iraq War. Routinely, Trump has avoided the normal Justice Department process for pardons, instead granting clemency to political allies and the well-connected.\nWednesday\u2019s announcement is unlikely to be the last batch of clemency the president unleashes. Trump has told aides, advisers, allies, lawmakers and others to bring him names for consideration, according to two people who have spoken to him. Like others, they spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\u201cHe wants to pardon people,\u201d one of these people said. \u201cIf you have someone, now is the time.\u201d\nThe move sparked blowback, mostly from Democrats, who accused him of wielding his executive authority to shield himself from possible criminal investigation.\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) called for eliminating the presidential pardon power.\n\u201cOnce one party allows the pardon power to become a tool of criminal enterprise, its danger to democracy outweighs its utility as an instrument of justice,\u201d Murphy tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s time to remove the pardon power from the Constitution.\u201d\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said, \u201cThis is rotten to the core.\u201d\nWith Wednesday\u2019s pardon of Manafort, Trump has now intervened to aid five people charged in the Russia probe, which was eventually taken over by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. The White House announcement made no secret that Trump was taking aim at that investigation; it said Manfort\u2019s convictions were \u201cpremised on the Russian collusion hoax,\u201d and that the pardon for Stone would \u201chelp to right the injustices he faced at the hands of the Mueller investigation.\u201d\nGrant Smith, a Stone attorney, said in a statement: \u201cWhen the paperwork arrives from the Department of Justice, Mr. Stone will promptly sign the acceptance of the Presidential Pardon. He is humbled that President Trump used his Constitutional power to allow Mr. & Mrs. Stone to put this behind them and move on with their lives.\u201d\nStone himself issued a lengthy statement attacking the case and thanking Trump for \u201chis extraordinary act of justice.\u201d\nA Twitter account for Manafort, which appears to have been dormant for years, posted Wednesday night, \u201cMr. President, my family & I humbly thank you for the Presidential Pardon you bestowed on me. Words cannot fully convey how grateful we are. \u2026 You truly did \u2018Make America Great Again.\u2019 God Bless you & your family. I wish you a Merry Christmas & many good wishes for the coming years.\u201d\nIn November, Trump pardoned former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his dealings with the Russian ambassador to the United States, though he later sought to take it back. In July, he commuted the sentence for Stone, who was convicted of seeking to impede a congressional investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and sentenced to 40 months in prison. And on Tuesday, he pardoned George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to his 2016 campaign who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during its Russia investigation, and Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch lawyer who pleaded guilty in 2018 to lying to Mueller\u2019s team.\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) tweeted, \u201cPardons for Paul Manafort and Roger Stone serve neither justice nor mercy. President Trump is handing out rewards to his co-conspirators and shielding his own conduct from scrutiny.\u201d\nThe list of those pardoned Wednesday was eclectic, and included a former congressman convicted of acting as a foreign agent, a Prince George\u2019s County, Md., police officer convicted of releasing her police dog to attack a man who had surrendered, and a Border Patrol agent who kicked and punched suspects whom he took into custody after a chase. On Tuesday, Trump pardoned former Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.), who pleaded guilty to using campaign funds on personal matters. On Wednesday, he pardoned Hunter\u2019s wife, Margaret, who pleaded guilty in the case before her husband and agreed to cooperate.\nTrump has drawn significant criticism for how he has used his pardon power, though one adviser said the president is unconcerned about the blowback.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just burning it all down,\u201d this person said. The adviser said the president has also discussed pardoning Stephen K. Bannon, his former chief strategist, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer, and will issue dozens more before he leaves office.\nTrump flew to his resort at Mar-a-Lago Wednesday, where he was greeted by hundreds of supporters along his motorcade route. The mostly unmasked supporters waved Trump flags and signs and chanted \u201cFour more years!\u201d One small boy had a sign that said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to miss you.\u201d\nThe practical effect of Trump\u2019s latest move was particularly significant for Manafort, who had been facing a 7 1/ 2 -year federal prison sentence, though he was released to home confinement in May, about two years in, over dangers posed by the coronavirus pandemic. Manafort was found guilty in federal court in Virginia in 2018 of stashing the money he made as a lobbyist from Ukrainian oligarchs overseas to avoid taxes and then committing bank fraud to keep up a lavish lifestyle when his patrons lost power. He then pleaded guilty to related charges in federal court in D.C. and pledged to cooperate with the special counsel, but a judge concluded that he lied to investigators, notably about his interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik, a longtime Manafort aide assessed by the FBI to have ties to Russian intelligence.\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Manafort gave Kilimnik internal Trump campaign polling data; Mueller\u2019s investigators said they were never able to determine how Kilimnik used the information.\nManafort could still face legal jeopardy from state authorities in New York, which would be outside the reach of a presidential pardon, though so far authorities there have faced an uphill battle.\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance had sought to bring a mortgage fraud case against Manafort after his federal convictions, but a court dismissed it on double jeopardy grounds. Vance, though, has been taking steps to revive the effort, and Danny Frost, a spokesman for his office, said in a statement Wednesday, \u201cThis action underscores the urgent need to hold Mr. Manafort accountable for his crimes against the People of New York as alleged in our indictment, and we will continue to pursue our appellate remedies.\u201d\nCharles Kushner, who was sentenced to two years in prison, already had served his time. Among the allegations brought by prosecutors were that he paid for an unnamed individual\u2019s private school tuition out of company accounts and declared the payments as charitable contributions on his tax returns, according to court documents. The White House cited campaign adviser Matt Schlapp\u2019s support of Charles Kushner\u2019s pardon, along with the support of a former U.S. attorney in Utah.\nUpon his release, Charles Kushner resumed practicing real estate development, and his New Jersey-based firm manages more than 20,000 apartments in New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia and Tennessee.\nJared Kushner, husband of Ivanka Trump, has long held that the prosecution against his father, led by then-U.S. Attorney Chris Christie, was unjust, despite his father\u2019s guilty pleas. Trump has not spoken to the former New Jersey governor in several weeks, a person familiar with their relationship said, and Christie has repeatedly encouraged the president publicly to stop trying to overturn the election. Christie had no comment.\nAccording to court documents, while Charles Kushner was under investigation for campaign contributions, he grew angry when he learned that other family members were cooperating with the probe. He paid a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law in a New Jersey motel room, where hidden cameras had been set, and later had the tape mailed to his sister as a warning, according to the documents.\nThe conviction changed Jared Kushner\u2019s trajectory, he later said, from his goal of becoming a prosecutor. \u201cSeeing my father\u2019s situation, I felt what happened was obviously unjust in terms of the way they pursued him,\u201d he told a real estate magazine, the Real Deal, in 2014. \u201cI just never wanted to be on the other side of that and cause pain to the families I was doing that to, whether right or wrong.\u201d\nJared Kushner\u2019s continued ownership stake in his family\u2019s business while working in the White House repeatedly raised concerns among ethics officials and experts, particularly when the Kushner Cos. was seeking buyers and lenders for its money-losing project at 666 Fifth Avenue in New York. Brookfield Properties took over the property from the Kushners in 2018 and renamed it 660 Fifth.\nCharles Kushner told the New York Times in 2018 that he would \u201cprefer not to have a pardon\u201d because of the publicity it would generate.\nTrump also pardoned former GOP congressman Mark Siljander of Michigan who in 2010 pleaded guilty to charges of obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent on behalf of an Islamic charity that hired Siljander to lobby Congress to have its name removed from a list of alleged terrorist-supporting organizations. In 2012, Siljander was sentenced to a year in federal prison.\nTrump similarly pardoned Stephanie Mohr, a former Maryland police officer who served 10 years in federal prison for allowing her police dog to bite and restrain a burglary suspect in 1995. The bite wound required 10 stitches on the calf of the suspect, an unarmed homeless man. A federal jury convicted Mohr, then 30, of violating his civil rights by releasing her police dog to attack him.\nTrump also pardoned Gary Brugman, a former Border Patrol agent who spent 27 months in federal prison for assaulting a Mexican national who illegally crossed the U.S. border into Texas. A federal jury convicted Brugman of violating the man\u2019s civil rights.\nAnd he pardoned Jesse Benton, a former aide to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who backed the pardon. Benton was convicted of an attempt to buy an endorsement for Ron Paul\u2019s 2012 presidential bid. Benton had worked for a PAC affiliated with Trump but resigned after the charges were filed.",
            "President Donald Trump on Wednesday delivered several more pardons, a day after he delivered a series of pardons and commutations.\nThe president issued full pardons to his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, associate Roger Stone, and Charles Kushner, a real estate developer and the father of Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner..\nManafort was convicted as part of the special counsel probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump had earlier commuted the criminal sentence of Stone, who was convicted of lying under oath to lawmakers.\nStone had this reaction on Wednesday night: \u201dOn behalf of my family and myself, I wish to praise God and give my deepest thanks to President Donald J. Trump for his extraordinary act of justice in issuing me a presidential pardon, completely erasing the criminal conviction to which I was subjected in a Soviet-style show trial on politically-motivated charges, further corrupted by egregious, illegal misconduct by the Jury Forewoman in the case.\u201d\nThe Manafort and Stone pardons seemed to underscore the president's determinastion to use the power of his office in his final weeks to unravel the results of the Russia probe, which Trump has long dubbed a \u201dhoax.\u201d\nAs for Charles Kushner, he's the father of Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and a wealthy real estate executive who pleaded guilty years ago to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations.\nTrump and the elder Kushner knew each other from real estate circles and their children were married in 2009.\nThe latest clemency activity comes after a busy Tuesday string of commutations and pardons: Trump pardoned 15 people, including Republican allies, and former government contractors convicted in a 2007 massacre in Baghdad.\nHe also pardoned George Papadopoulos, his 2016 campaign adviser whose conversation unwittingly helped trigger the Russia investigation that shadowed Trump\u2019s presidency for nearly two years.\nAnd he commuted the sentences of five others.\nIt's common for presidents to exercise their clemency power as their terms near their conclusion. Joe Biden is to be sworn in as president on Jan. 20, though Trump continues to challenge the outcome of the Nov. 3 vote.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.\nThis is a developing story.",

The beneficiaries included three GOP congressmen who separately were convicted of or pleaded guilty to various corruption charges, two individuals caught up in the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election investigation, and four ex-security contractors who were convicted for their involvement in the 2007 killings of 17 unarmed Iraqi civilians in Baghdad.\nOn Wednesday night, Trump announced pardons for associates Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortTrump's final weeks create chaos for Congress Trump pardons include former officer who released police dog on man Paul Manafort: Handmaiden to dictators MORE and Roger Stone Roger Jason StoneTrump's final weeks create chaos for Congress Trump pardons include former officer who released police dog on man Paul Manafort: Handmaiden to dictators MORE, who were both convicted as part of the Mueller investigation.

Tuesday night's announcement marked more of the same, experts said.\n\u201dPrevious presidents have pardoned supporters and allies, and they haven\u2019t always relied on the Office of the Pardon Attorney,\u201d said Kermit Roosevelt, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. \u201dBut Trump has taken it to a new level. There\u2019s no prior president who has used the pardon power in such a partisan way or to pardon people whose misconduct was so closely related to the president.\u201d\nSome of the president's pardons on Tuesday appeared blatantly political. He pardoned former Rep. Chris Collins Christopher (Chris) Carl CollinsTrump's final weeks create chaos for Congress Trump pardons draw criticism for benefiting political allies Trump's pardons expose another gap in US legal system MORE (R-N.Y.), who was the first congressman to support Trump's 2016 bid for president.

Duncan Hunter Duncan HunterTrump's final weeks create chaos for Congress Trump pardons Manafort, Stone and Charles Kushner in latest round Trump pardons draw criticism for benefiting political allies MORE (R-Calif.), another early supporter, despite the ex-congressman pleading guilty to misusing campaign funds last year.\n\u201dFor corrupt politicians who want to enrich themselves in the swamp of Washington D.C., it is good to have Donald Trump as a friend,\u201d Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at progressive think tank Public Citizen, said in a statement.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFormer Trump campaign aide George PapadopoulosGeorge Demetrios PapadopoulosTrump pardons draw criticism for benefiting political allies Klobuchar: Trump 'trying to burn this country down on his way out' Trump's pardons expose another gap in US legal system MORE was given a pardon after he pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigations in relation to the Russia investigation led by former special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) MuellerBarr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel CNN's Toobin warns McCabe is in 'perilous condition' with emboldened Trump CNN anchor rips Trump over Stone while evoking Clinton-Lynch tarmac meeting MORE. Papadopoulos, who has been a vocal defender of Trump, served 12 days in prison in 2018. He was the first of six Trump associates charged in Mueller\u2019s sprawling 22-month probe.\nThe pardons of the ex-contractors involved in the killings of Iraqi civilians drew rebukes from civil rights groups in particular. The executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim advocacy group, called it \u201dan unconscionable act of moral insanity.\u201d\nThe four ex-contractors worked for Blackwater, a firm founded by Erik Prince, one of Trump's allies and the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos Betsy DeVosTrump pardons draw criticism for benefiting political allies Klobuchar: Trump 'trying to burn this country down on his way out' Stopping the abuse of the pardon power MORE.\n\u201dThe idea of the pardon power is really to address injustice and to either right wrongs or show mercy when that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\u201dAnd in the case of Donald Trump, it\u2019s been turned on its head,\u201d he continued. \u201dThere have been a few pardons that seem to be based on excessively long sentences for drug offenses, although even those have come through connections rather than through the regular process.\u201d\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe highest-profile example is Alice Johnson, who was serving a life sentence for a drug offense. Johnson's clemency was widely celebrated, but Kim Kardashian West Kimberly (Kim) Noel Kardashian WestTrump pardons draw criticism for benefiting political allies Dozens of Democrats urge Biden to quickly end federal death penalty Federal government executes Louisiana man who killed 2-year-old daughter MORE had strongly advocated for it. Johnson later spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention, after which Trump gave her a full pardon.\nThere have been other lesser-known figures Trump has used his pardon powers to benefit. Those include Roy Wayne McKeever, who served a year of prison time for using a telephone in distributing marijuana, and Jon Ponder, a convicted bank robber who later founded an organization to help reintegrate convicts into society upon their release.\nBut Trump's most high-profile acts of clemency have mostly gone around the official pardon office and been bestowed upon allies and supporters.\nTrump had already granted clemency to Roger Stone and Michael Flynn, two associates and supporters who were investigated by Trump's own Justice Department. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, while Stone had been convicted of lying to Congress.\nHe also pardoned Joe Arpaio, a former Arizona sheriff who was one of the president's early supporters, as well as conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza.\nExperts acknowledge that it is not unusual for presidents to extend the power of the pardon to political allies and to do so in their final days or weeks in office. They pointed to former President Clinton, who pardoned more than 100 people on his final day in office and drew scrutiny for his decision to grant clemency to Marc Rich, whose ex-wife was a major donor to Democrats.\nBut as with many aspects of the presidency, Trump has pushed the boundaries, and ethics watchdogs worry he will continue to do so in his final weeks in office. Trump is reportedly considering granting preemptive pardons to his adult children and his personal attorney, and legal scholars have discussed whether the president could pardon himself to avoid charges should the next attorney general investigate his actions in office.\n\u201dLike so many other things in our system of checks and balances, the pardon power relied on restraint and good judgment and commitment to democratic and ethical ideals by the president and those around him,\u201d Bookbinder said. \u201dBut as with so many other facets of the presidency, it has turned out that when you don\u2019t have judgment and restraint, there are a lot fewer guardrails and fewer limits than we thought there were.\u201d"

        "context": "PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday granted pardons to former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former adviser Roger Stone, sweeping away the most important convictions under the long-running Russia election probe. Trump also issued a pardon for Charles Kushner, a real estate developer and the father of Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Trump, taking advantage of a right granted by the Constitution only to the president, has issued two groups of pardons in as many days, and more are anticipated as Trump faces the end of his presidency on Jan. 20. The announcement came just after Trump arrived in Palm Beach, Florida, for the holiday season, with Jared Kushner on the Air Force One flight with him. In total, Trump issued on Wednesday pardons to 26 individuals and commuted part or all of the sentences of an additional three people. A commutation removes the punishment but leaves the conviction in place. Of special interest for Trump has been attacking the results of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign, a case Trump repeatedly dismissed as a political witch hunt. Reacting to Wednesday\u2019s pardons, Republican Senator Ben Sasse, in a six-word statement, said: \u201cThis is rotten to the core.\u201d Besides Manafort and Stone, Trump has pardoned two other major figures from the Russia probe, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former adviser George Papadopoulos. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, which has been trying to prosecute Manafort in New York for mortgage fraud and other alleged crimes, said it would continue to pursue an appeal for its case, which was dismissed on double jeopardy grounds. Slideshow ( 3 images ) \u201cThis action underscores the urgent need to hold Mr. Manafort accountable for his crimes against the People of New York as alleged in our indictment, and we will continue to pursue our appellate remedies,\u201d said Danny Frost, spokesman for the office. FIGURES IN RUSSIA INVESTIGATION The Manafort pardon spared the long-time Republican operative from serving the bulk of his 7-1/2-year prison term. Manafort, 70, was among the first in Trump\u2019s inner circle to face charges brought by Mueller as part of his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Manafort worked on Trump\u2019s White House campaign for five months in 2016. In 2018, Trump called him a \u201cbrave man\u201d for not cooperating with federal authorities. Evidence from the Russia investigation indicated that Trump intended to encourage Manafort \u201cnot to cooperate with the government,\u201d according to Mueller\u2019s report. In a statement relayed by his lawyer, Manafort expressed his appreciation to Trump. \u201cMr. President, my family & I humbly thank you for the Presidential Pardon you bestowed on me. Words cannot fully convey how grateful we are,\u201d he said. Slideshow ( 3 images ) Andrew Weissmann, a top Mueller deputy who oversaw Manafort\u2019s prosecution by the special counsel, noted that Manafort has served roughly two years of his sentence, and that assets seized in civil forfeiture proceedings would fall outside the pardon. \u201cSo, there still are consequences to Paul Manafort, they are just not commensurate with the extensive criminality that he was convicted of and plead guilty to,\u201d Weissmann said on CNN. Stone was convicted in November 2019 by a Washington jury of lying under oath to lawmakers also investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump commuted his sentence in July, a day before Stone was due to begin serving a term of three years and four months. Stone, in a statement, thanked Trump for \u201ccompletely erasing the criminal conviction to which I was subjected in a Soviet-style show trial on politically-motivated charges.\u201d Charles Kushner was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty in 2004 to 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering and making unlawful campaign donations. In an unusual twist, the man who prosecuted Charles Kushner was Chris Christie, now the former governor of New Jersey, who also has served as an adviser to Trump. Christie was quoted by CNN as saying Charles Kushner\u2019s case was \u201cone of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes\u201d he prosecuted. During the case, Charles Kushner admitted to smearing his brother-in-law, who had cooperated with prosecutors, by hiring a prostitute to have sex with him in a motel room, then sending a secretly recorded video of the encounter to the man\u2019s wife, Charles Kushner\u2019s own sister. A pardon in practice grants full legal forgiveness for a federal crime, as a result removing any remaining prison sentence, probation conditions or unpaid fines. It also relieves the person of the potential consequences of a felony conviction, such as being barred from voting, running for public office and owning a gun.",
        "summarized_context": "President Donald Trump has pardoned his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, his longtime adviser Roger Stone, and Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner. The move sparked blowback, mostly from Democrats, who accused him of wielding his executive authority to shield himself from possible criminal investigation. Trump had previously resisted offering Manafort a pardon, likely in part because doing so posed a political risk. His decision to move forward now appeared at least a tacit acknowledgment that his presidency is nearing an end, despite asserting without evidence that he was robbed of a victory by widespread election fraud."

            "(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is investigating a potential crime related to funneling money to the White House in exchange for a presidential pardon, according to court documents unsealed in federal court.\nU.S. District Judge Beryl Howell on Tuesday released a heavily redacted order that described what she called a \u201cbribery-for-pardon\u201d investigation.\nAbout half of the 18-page document was blacked out, with the publicly available version providing few details of the alleged scheme, and naming none of the people potentially involved.\nIt said federal prosecutors in Washington said they had obtained evidence of a bribery scheme in which someone \u201cwould offer a substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentence.\u201d\nThe order said prosecutors were also investigating a \u201csecret lobbying scheme\u201d in which two unidentified individuals \u201cacted as lobbyists to senior White House officials, without complying with the registration requirement of the Lobbying Disclosure Act.\u201d\nA Justice Department official said no government official is or was a target of the investigation.\nThe Justice Department had to ask Howell\u2019s permission to view certain emails between a lawyer and clients, who were not identified.\nHowell granted the request in August, saying attorney-client privilege did not apply in that instance.\nProsecutors had said they planned to \u201cconfront\u201d three unnamed individuals with the communications and finish their investigation.\nAccording to Howell\u2019s order, government investigators said they had seized \u201cover fifty digital media devices, including iPhones, iPads, laptops, thumb drives, and computer and external hard drives.\u201d\nPresidents enjoy wide latitude under the U.S. Constitution in pardoning people convicted of federal crimes. President Donald Trump last week pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\nThat was the first of what is expected to be a string of pardons in Trump\u2019s final weeks in the White House.\nAccording to Howell\u2019s order, the Justice Department had recently told her it wanted to keep the investigation from becoming public because it detailed \u201cindividuals and conduct\u201d that had not yet been charged.",

Giuliani tweeted a denial.\nThe court disclosure unleashed a whirlwind of speculation in Washington. The Democrat Adam Schiff, the chair of the House of Representatives\u2019 intelligence committee, told the MSNBC network: \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t presume \u2013 and there may be a tendency to leap to the \u2013 that this may involve some of the personalities that have been very much in the news and are worried about their criminal liability.\n\u201cIt may be someone that we\u2019ve never heard of that wants a pardon and is well-heeled and therefore in a position to make a sizeable contribution. So it doesn\u2019t have to be any of the parties that we think that may want a pardon: the [Paul] Manaforts, the Giulianis and others. It could be someone completely different but, at the end of the day, someone in that chain has to be close enough to the White House where they could conceivably deliver on the official act of pardon if the bribe were paid.\u201d\nReuters contributed reporting",

            "The Department of Justice (DOJ) is investigating a potentially criminal scheme involving paying a bribe to people either in or affiliated with the White House in exchange for an unknown person receiving a presidential pardon, according to court documents that were unsealed Tuesday.\nThe court records, which were unsealed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, say the DOJ investigation involves two people, whose names are redacted, who were improperly acting as lobbyists to secure the pardon for a person whose name is also redacted. The plot involved the person offering \u201ca substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentence.\u201d\nIt was not immediately clear for whom the pardon would be granted or where the bribe would be directed, and the documents provide no indication President Trump Donald John TrumpDozens of protesters gathered outside home of Michigan elections chief Arizona legislature shuts down after Giuliani tests positive for coronavirus Trump election claims dominate Georgia Senate debate MORE was aware of the plot.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe disclosure, contained in a 20-page filing littered with redactions, comes amid reports that Trump is considering pardoning an array of associates in the waning days of his presidency.\nThe new filing shows Chief Judge Beryl Howell was conducting a review in August of a request from federal prosecutors to examine documents that had been obtained from a search warrant as part of an investigation into the plot.\nThe release shows investigators recovered more than 50 digital devices, including iPhones, iPads, laptops and computer drives, after a raid of unidentified offices. The prosecutors were requesting access to the devices on suspicion that they showed alleged criminal activity regarding the \u201csecret lobbying scheme\u201d for the unnamed person.\nThe files indicate the devices contain communications between a defendant and an attorney, which are typically kept from prosecutors because they are considered privileged. However, such privilege is not applied when an exchange involves discussion of a crime, and Howell granted prosecutors access to the devices.\n\u201dThe political strategy to obtain a presidential pardon was 'parallel' to and distinct from [redacted]'s role as an attorney-advocate for [redacted name],\u201d Howell wrote in her court order.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe new documents do not include any names of the people involved or when the scheme was hatched. They do say the two people who were working to organize the agreement were acting as lobbyists to senior administration officials but did not comply with the Lobbying Disclosure Act\u2019s registration requirement.\nIt also appears prosecutors have not yet provided evidence to the judge regarding a direct payment but that the person seeking a pardon was doing so for protection regarding political contributions they\u2019d made.\nNo charges have yet been filed that indicate a person has been prosecuted over the alleged bribery.\nSpeculation over possible grants of clemency in the waning days of Trump\u2019s presidency reached a fever pitch last week when Trump pardoned Michael Flynn, his first national security adviser, who pleaded guilty to a charge of lying to federal investigators about his contacts with the top Russian diplomat in the United States.

U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell on Tuesday released a heavily redacted order that described what she called a \u201cbribery-for-pardon\u201d investigation. About half of the 18-page document was blacked out, with the publicly available version providing few details of the alleged scheme, and naming none of the people potentially involved. It said federal prosecutors in Washington said they had obtained evidence of a bribery scheme in which someone \u201cwould offer a substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentence.\u201d The order said prosecutors were also investigating a \u201csecret lobbying scheme\u201d in which two unidentified individuals \u201cacted as lobbyists to senior White House officials, without complying with the registration requirement of the Lobbying Disclosure Act.\u201d A Justice Department official said no government official is or was a target of the investigation. The Justice Department had to ask Howell\u2019s permission to view certain emails between a lawyer and clients, who were not identified. Howell granted the request in August, saying attorney-client privilege did not apply in that instance. Prosecutors had said they planned to \u201cconfront\u201d three unnamed individuals with the communications and finish their investigation. According to Howell\u2019s order, government investigators said they had seized \u201cover fifty digital media devices, including iPhones, iPads, laptops, thumb drives, and computer and external hard drives.\u201d Presidents enjoy wide latitude under the U.S. Constitution in pardoning people convicted of federal crimes. President Donald Trump last week pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. That was the first of what is expected to be a string of pardons in Trump\u2019s final weeks in the White House. According to Howell\u2019s order, the Justice Department had recently told her it wanted to keep the investigation from becoming public because it detailed \u201cindividuals and conduct\u201d that had not yet been charged.",

            "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died on Friday. Her passing leaves a vacancy on the court in late September of a presidential election year\u2014seven months closer to Election Day than the vacancy that was left following the 2016 death of Justice Antonin Scalia.\nShortly after the news of that previous Supreme Court justice\u2019s death broke, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that his chamber would not consider a nominee to replace Scalia until after the 2016 election. \u201cThe American people\u200e should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President.\u201d\nThis time around, McConnell announced Friday night, the American people have said enough. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate,\u201d the bottom line read. It was preceded by some lawyerly language interpreting the previous six years\u2019 worth of electoral politics as proof positive that he had made the proper, fair decisions each step of the way. It\u2019s ignorable. There was a Supreme Court seat open in 2016 that he didn\u2019t want a Democrat to fill, so he kept it open. There is a Supreme Court seat open in 2020 that he wants a Republican to fill, so he\u2019ll try to fill it.\nIn order to do so, he needs 50 Republican votes plus Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s as a tiebreaker. This means he can only afford to lose three of his senators. He wouldn\u2019t commit to a floor vote if he didn\u2019t think he could get them. But he\u2019s putting his vulnerable Republican senators in an excruciating position.\nMaine Sen. Susan Collins, who\u2019s in a difficult reelection race in major part due to her deciding vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the court, told the New York Times earlier this month that she, in the Times\u2019 words, \u201cwould not seat a Supreme Court justice in October,\u201d and also that she would oppose seating a justice during the lame-duck session in the event of a transfer of power.\nAlaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who is not up for reelection this cycle, told Alaska Public Media in an interview Friday\u2014before she knew about Ginsburg\u2019s death\u2014that \u201cI would not vote to confirm a Supreme Court nominee. We are 50 some days away from an election.\u201d\nThat\u2019s two on the record already.\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who\u2019s also up for reelection, is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He told the Atlantic in 2018 that \u201cif an opening comes in the last year of President Trump\u2019s term, and the primary process has started, we\u2019ll wait to the next election\u201d\u2014and then added, \u201chold the tape.\u201d Here\u2019s the tape.\nColorado Sen. Cory Gardner is up for reelection in Colorado, which is now a lean-blue state. His career may be over already. It will certainly be over if he votes to confirm a new justice before the election. Sen. Martha McSally is trailing in her race in Arizona. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis is narrowly trailing in his. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst is an a tight race, while Texas Sen. John Cornyn, Montana Sen. Steve Daines, Georgia Sen. David Perdue, and, well, Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell all have races they can\u2019t sleep on. For some of them, it might be useful to enthusiastically activate their state\u2019s Republicans despite the ferocious backlash from Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters. For others it won\u2019t. They\u2019ll all have to figure that out immediately.\nThen there\u2019s Utah Sen. Mitt Romney. Would he go along with a straightforward power grab that would tear the country apart? Would retiring Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander?\nWhat McConnell\u2019s statement does not say is when \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d He left himself room, in other words, to hold the confirmation in the lame-duck session. If Trump wins reelection, that\u2019s the ballgame anyway. If Biden wins? Lame-duck senators won\u2019t be accountable anymore.\nDemocrats will be applying extraordinary pressure in the coming weeks on Republicans up for reelection in competitive races (and Mitt Romney!) to commit that they won\u2019t vote to confirm a nominee either before the election or in the lame-duck period. Those lame-duck Republicans could always change their word after the election. Some Democrats have already begun signaling that there would be consequences to that, too: an abolition of the filibuster and an expansion of the Supreme Court if Joe Biden becomes president and Democrats take the Senate majority.\nWe\u2019ve been in a slow-moving political crisis for some time. It\u2019s about to get fast. And the only certain thing is that Mitch McConnell will say it wasn\u2019t his fault.",

            "\u00a9 Bloomberg The U.S. Supreme Court building stands in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, Feb. 25, 2020. President Donald Trump demanded that Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg recuse themselves from future cases involving his administration after a dissent from a decision allowing the government to test prospective immigrants' wealth.\n(Bloomberg) -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would schedule a vote to confirm Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to succeed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg after her death Friday, giving the president an opportunity to cement a rightward tilt of the Supreme Court for a generation.\nWith the election less than two months away, McConnell said the Senate would act to fill the vacancy, even though he spent most of 2016 denying a confirmation hearing to President Barack Obama\u2019s pick to fill a vacancy on the high court.\nAmericans gave Republicans a Senate majority \u201cbecause we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary,\u201d McConnell said in a statement shortly after Ginsburg\u2019s death was announced. \u201cOnce again, we will keep our promise.

            "\u00a9 UPI Photo Ginsburg death sets up battle over future of court\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the liberal leader of the Supreme Court, died Friday at the age of 87, less than two months before an election that is likely to decide the future of the Supreme Court for at least a generation.\nAbout an hour after a court spokesperson confirmed Ginsburg's death from pancreatic cancer, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) vowed that he would hold a Senate vote on her replacement if Trump names a new Supreme Court nominee.\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) maintained that the vacancy left by her death should be filled by whoever wins in November.\n\u201dThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\u201d Schumer tweeted.\nTop Senate Republicans as recently as this summer have said they would confirm a new justice if given the chance despite 2020 being an election year, a reversal of their rationale for blocking former President Obama's nominee late in his second term.\nTrump, for his part, unveiled a list of 20 additional judicial prospects earlier this month that he said would consider nominating to the bench. At the time, Trump's strategy appeared aimed at energizing GOP voters, but the Supreme Court vacancy created by Ginsburg's death fundamentally altered the political calculus.\nIn blunt terms, Trump now has a chance to transform the Supreme Court from a fragile 5-4 conservative majority into a commanding 6-3 conservative supermajority, which could have long-term implications that affect the day-to-day lives of everyone in the country.\nThe result could be that relatively stable areas of law - over issues like gun control, abortion and voting rights - are loosed from their legal moorings, giving conservative groups an opportunity to roll back liberal gains and further their own legal agenda.\nThe move would push the court's fulcrum to the right of its current ideological center, Chief Justice John Roberts, whose stewardship of the court is seen by some conservatives with increasing skepticism.\nIn the term that ended in July, the Roberts Court dealt major blows to cherished conservative causes. On narrow margins, the court struck down a Louisiana abortion restriction, blocked the Trump administration from ending an Obama-era deportation shield for young undocumented immigrants and extended federal anti-discrimination workplace protections to LGBT people.\nBut if Trump wins another four-year term, he faces the possibility of choosing a successor to liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, 82. Replacing both Ginsburg and Breyer would give Trump the chance to hand conservatives a powerful 7-2 majority on the bench.\nThe next oldest member is conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, 72, the longest-serving member of the current court and whose 28 years on the bench is longer than the typical justice's tenure, though his friends and colleagues say he has no plans to step down.\nThe president's new list of Supreme Court candidates includes a half-dozen former clerks of Thomas, a reflection of the staunch conservative's growing clout in the Trump era and the president's commitment to nominating replacements in his likeness.\n\u201dThe 20 additions I am announcing today would be jurists in the mold of Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito,\u201d Trump said during Sept. 9 remarks in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House.\nThe records of Thomas and Alito, like the late Scalia, who died in 2016, are generally seen as falling to the right of the court's other conservatives: Roberts and Trump's two nominees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\nUpdated at 10:03 p.m.",
            "\u00a9 Republican National Convention Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, speaks during the Republican National Convention at the Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C., Thursday, Aug. 27, 2020.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled Friday they will move soon to start the politically fraught process of filling the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\nMcConnell asserted shortly after Ginsburg's passing that he intended to bring a Trump nominee to the Senate floor for a vote. And a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal discussions, confirmed Trump intends to choose a nominee soon, though declined to discuss a specific timeline.\n\u201dPresident Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate,\u201d McConnell said.\nStart the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.\n\u201dAmericans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary,\u201d he added. \u201dOnce again, we will keep our promise.\u201d\nTrump and McConnell talked about specific candidates in a phone call Friday night with McConnell, said two people familiar with the call, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation.\nBut while Republicans may be eager to move quickly, the process is certain to get swept up in the divisive presidential election and the actual timeline could depend on the outcome of the November election. Several GOP senators have expressed reservations in the past about moving a confirmation so close to an election.\nThe vacancy has major implications for the court, handing Trump an opportunity to create a solidly conservative court perhaps for decades to come.\nTrump was speaking at a campaign rally in Minnesota when news of Ginsburg's death broke. Afterward, he told reporters he she led an \u201damazing\u201d life.\n\u201dWhat else can you say? She was an amazing woman, whether you agree or not,\u201d Trump said. \u201dShe was an amazing woman who led an amazing life. I'm actually sad to hear that.\u201d\nSupreme Court nominees generally take months to win confirmation \u2013 even longer if controversy arises. Trump nominated Justice Neil Gorsuch in January 2017, days after taking office, and the Senate did not confirm him until April. The nomination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, delayed by allegations of sexual assault, took three months in 2018.\nThat timing makes it unlikely that Republicans could secure a confirmation by the election, but it would leave plenty of room to approve a nominee during a lame duck session regardless of whether Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden wins in November. If Democrats win control of the Senate that could further complicate the politics of a Supreme Court confirmation.\nSince McConnell adjusted the Senate rules in 2017, the chamber\u2019s majority has had the power to confirm a Supreme Court nominee with a simple majority. That means McConnell, with a 53-47 majority, could afford to lose only three Republicans \u2013 assuming all Democrats vote against Trump\u2019s nominee.\nIn the past, however, some Democrats have backed Trump's Supreme Court nominees. Three voted for Gorsuch. One voted for Kavanaugh.\nMcConnell is still widely remembered for refusing to give President Barack Obama's last appointee to the high court, Judge Merrick Garland, a Senate hearing in 2016. And Democrats were quick to echo McConnell's arguments at the time.\n\u201dThere is no doubt \u2013 let me clear \u2013 that the voters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice for the Senate to consider,\u201d Biden said Friday. \u201dThis was the position the Republican Senate took in 2016 when there were almost 10 months to go before the election. That's the position the United States Senate must take today.\u201d\nMore: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dies, setting up nomination fight\nMore: Second woman on Supreme Court had been leading litigator for women's rights\nWhite House aides have long said Trump would nominate a replacement as soon as there is a vacancy. Earlier this month, Trump unveiled a new list of 20 potential nominees, part of an effort to his signal the direction he would take the court if reelected.\nTrump officials in the past have described two potential candidates as favorites: Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who he placed on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, and Judge Amul Thapar of the 6th Circuit appeals court, a McConnell favorite.\nAides said they expect Trump to nominate a replacement soon, but did not want to discuss the process out of respect for Ginsburg.\nOn July 15, amid questions about Ginsburg's health, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters that Trump would seek to fill any vacancy before Election Day.\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that if he had a vacancy on the Supreme Court that he would not very quickly make the appointment and look for the Senate to take quick action,\u201d he said. \u201dThat being said, we\u2019re glad that Ruth Bader Ginsburg is well and out of the hospital and I don\u2019t want any comment there to be a suggestion that we do anything but wish her the very best in health.\u201d\nDespite McConnell's vow to move ahead, some members of his conference have voiced hesitancy, especially if the vacancy came close to an election.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. and a close ally of the president, vowed in 2018 he would not fill a vacancy if it came too close to the election.\n\u201dIf an opening comes in the last year of President Trump\u2019s term, and the primary process has started, we\u2019ll wait until the next election,\u201d he said at the time.\nGraham chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, the panel that would be tasked with the nomination process for a new justice.\nIn 2018, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa and one of the most senior members of the Senate, similarly said he would not consider a nominee during an election. He played a key role in 2016 as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, vowing not to start the nomination process of Garland.\n\u201dBecause I pledged that in 2016,\u201d Grassley said, explaining his rationale. \u201dThat's a decision I made a long time ago.\u201d\nThe issue is also likely to be a challenge for moderate Republicans and those facing tough races in November. Polling has shown Democratic candidates up in several states, leaving the GOP's 53-47 majority in danger.\nA source close to McConnell told USA TODAY that this vacancy will leave the Kentucky Republican in a bind given how other Republican senators might react to the news of Ginsburg's death.\n\u201dHis hands may be tied,\u201d the source said. \u201dWe just don't know yet.\u201d\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, described Ginsburg as a \u201dtrailblazer for women\u2019s rights, a fierce champion for equality.\u201d Collins' aides declined to discuss the senator's thoughts on timing for a confirmation.\nSen. Lisa Murkwoski, R-Alaska, a key moderate in the chamber, already has poured cold water on the idea of filling a vacancy so close to November, telling The Hill in August that doing so would be a \u201ddouble standard\u201d after Garland.\n\u201dI would not support it,\u201d she said.\nOpponents said Trump and the Republicans would pay a political price if they try to rush a replacement onto the high court.\n\u201dThis seat will be filled in due time,\u201d tweeted Neal Katyal, a legal commentator and former acting solicitor general.\n\u201dIf Trump tries to rush it, he will be monkeying with the Court, w/devastating consequences,\u201d he said in a tweet. \u201dFor now, let's take a deep breath and remember the legacy RBG left us.\u201d\nSarah Isgur, a former Justice Department official during the Trump administration, said she doubts the Senate would confirm a nominee before Election Day, so the selection will be a huge election issue.\n\u201dTrump could name the nominee, but tell his voters they don\u2019t get the seat unless they turn out to vote for him,\u201d Isgur said. \u201dNow he has the opportunity to force wobbly Rs to vote for him.\u201d\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: McConnell says Senate will vote on Trump's nominee to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Supreme Court seat",

It was 268 days before the November election and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) was quick to quip that there would not be a replacement until the next president was chosen.\nOn Friday evening, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died of complications from cancer 46 days before the presidential election. But McConnell has already made it clear that he sees no reason to wait for voters to weigh in on who should pick her replacement. The Kentucky Republican declared just hours after the death was announced: \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d\nMcConnell\u2019s monomaniacal focus on filling the courts with young conservatives will be tested in the next few months by a variety of factors.

Lisa Murkowksi (R-AK), has said she would not support filing a Supreme Court vacancy in 2020, citing the Garland precedent, a position she reiterated on Friday night. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) had made a similar declaration. And even close Trump allies\u2014albeit ideologically heterodoxical ones\u2014were making arguments to let the election conclude before filling the post.\n\u201cOf course they should [wait] but they won\u2019t,\u201d Alan Dershowitz, a celebrity attorney who also served on Trump\u2019s legal defense during the impeachment trial, said on Friday night, reacting to the news. \u201cI\u2019m deeply distressed. She was a great woman, a great justice, and a great American\u2026 I think the Republicans are going to try to push it through\u2026 If it\u2019s a close election, they will want to have their justices on the bench.\u201d\nAsked if he had the chance, what he would say to President Trump now, Dershowitz added, \u201cI would say Republicans ought to stick to their position that they took when Scalia died\u2026 Let the American people decide who they want to see nominate the next Supreme Court justice.\u201d\nBut elsewhere, there were not many overt calls for patience from Trump world figures. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who chairs the Judiciary Committee through which any nomination must go, had previously said he would also oppose any confirmation during an election year. But the senator also finds himself in a dogged re-election fight, with a particular need to ramp up support from conservative voters in his state. The statement he released after Ginsburg\u2019s death conveyed no position on\u2014and, therefore, no hesitation with\u2014filling the seat.\n\u201cIt was with great sadness that I learned of the passing of Justice Ginsburg,\u201d Graham said. \u201cJustice Ginsburg was a trailblazer who possessed tremendous passion for her causes. She served with honor and distinction as a member of the Supreme Court. While I had many differences with her on legal philosophy, I appreciate her service to our nation. My thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends. May she Rest In Peace.\u201d\nFor Democrats, there are few if any tools they possess to stop a nomination from going through, save mustering up an overwhelming amount of public pressure to persuade those four Republicans to not only oppose a nominee through the election, but through the period after the election until the next president is inaugurated.\nIt\u2019s a gargantuan task. On Capitol Hill there was shock among aides at the news Friday night. Publicly, Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) tweeted that \u201cthis vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president\u201d\u2014adopting, verbatim, the language McConnell had used after Scalia\u2019s death.\nBut among some in the party the question was not whether McConnell would push for a nominee, but when.\n\u201cI think the only question is whether he tries to jam it through now or the lame duck. Either would be a clear abuse of the process but that won\u2019t stop McConnell,\u201d said Jim Manley, a former top aide to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV). \u201cUnder no scenario,\u201d Manley added, would McConnell wait until the next president.\n\nVideo: Biden: Next president should fill Ginsburg's seat (Reuters - US Video Online)\nManley said that it was his suspicion that the process would happen after the election due to the sheer logistics of getting a nominee confirmed. There was, he noted, the need for a background investigation, a review by the Judiciary Committee itself, a hearing on the nominee, and procedural hurdles that could drag out two or more weeks. The average number of days to confirm a Supreme Court justice is 70, according to the Congressional Research Service. But there is also nothing that prevents McConnell from scrapping those norms and rules altogether, should he want to expedite matters.\n\u201cRules are rules, but they\u2019ve long become accustomed to them breaking the norms,\u201d said Manley.\nWithin the GOP conference, there\u2019s less of a clear sense as to what McConnell will do. The Kentucky senator, focused on retaining the GOP majority at all costs this fall, faces a situation where the politics of an election eve Supreme Court fight could have varying effects for his most vulnerable members. A key swing vote for Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), faces the re-election battle of her career this fall, and could burnish the independent image she touts by opposing any confirmation. Other moderates in tough races could make similar calculations. So too could Sen. Mitt Romney\u2014the president\u2019s sharpest GOP critic in the senate\u2014as well as several retiring Republicans.\nTo placate those members, McConnell could hold off until after the election. But he\u2019s not the only actor in this play. Trump has long credited his 2016 win to the conservative voter enthusiasm over the possibility of filling a Supreme Court vacancy. And a potential vacancy at the high court has never been far from the minds of top White House officials. Earlier this month during a formal press conference in the Diplomatic Reception Room, Trump announced he had expanded his list of possible judicial picks by 20 individuals including Sens. Ted Cruz (TX), Tom Cotton (AR) and Josh Hawley (IN) as well as a rising Republican rising star, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron.\n\u201cShould there be another vacancy on the Supreme Court during my presidency, my nominee will come from the names I have shared with the American public, including the original list and these 20 additions,\u201d Trump said during a press conference on Sept. 9.\nTrump then challenged former Vice President Joe Biden to release a list of potential nominees\u2014a dare the Democratic nominee has, so far, ignored.\nBut while Trump recently produced a fresh list of potential nominees, speculation about whom he would pick has centered largely around Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who serves on the Seventh Court of Appeals. In picking Barrett, Trump would please his conservative base but also create a potentially thorny confirmation process at a time when tensions are already at a fever pitch.\nA former clerk for Justice Antonin Scalia, Barrett has the reputation as a conservative, but in many ways is still untested on major issues that could come up before the Supreme Court.\nAt 48, Barrett would be the youngest of the potential justices Trump has considered for the court and she has the least experience of anyone on the Supreme Court bench.\nNews of Ginsburg\u2019s death broke as Trump was at a Minnesota campaign rally, giddily running through a standard roster of applause lines. As he spoke, he did not appear to know about the political and legal grenade that had just been tossed into official Washington. Two Trump aides told The Daily Beast mid-speech that the president didn\u2019t know, though various other senior administration officials were well aware and preparing to discuss the matter with him, as soon as later in the evening.\nThough apparently not yet informed of Ginsburg\u2019s death, Trump did mention the importance of the court\u2014part of a familiar rally riff that took on new weight in light of the new political reality.\n\u201cAnd that's why the Supreme Court is so important, because the next president will get one, two, three or four Supreme Court justices,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI had two. Many presidents have had none, they've had none, because they're there for a long time.\u201d\nAt the White House in Washington, DC, the American flag was quickly lowered on Friday to half-staff in memory of Justice Ginsburg, according to White House spokesman Ben Williamson.\nAs Trump boarded Air Force One, he told reporters he had just learned of Ginsberg\u2019s death.\n\u201dJust now?\u201d he responded when asked about her death, according to CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. \u201cShe led an amazing life. What else can you say? She was an amazing woman \u2014 whether you agree or not \u2014 she was an amazing woman who led an amazing life.\u201d\nRead more at The Daily Beast.",

            "\u00a9 Greg Nash What Senate Republicans have said about election-year Supreme Court vacancies\nSenate Republicans have different views over whether a vacancy on the Supreme Court should be filled this late in an election cycle.\nSeveral Senate Republicans who face tough reelection battles in 2020 have in the past said it's too late and that the next president should decide.\nOthers, led by Sens. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.), are saying the GOP should move forward to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court following the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\nRepublicans close to the White House expect Trump to put forth a nominee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) says any potential nominee will get a vote.\nMcConnell and then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) blocked Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, from getting a hearing ahead of the 2016 election. Scalia died in mid-February of 2016.\nHere's a look at what Republican senators have said about the issue so far.\nSen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.)\nMcSally became the first GOP senator to announce her support for filling the Supreme Court vacancy Friday night.\n\u201dThis U.S. Senate should vote on President Trump's next nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d McSally said over Twitter.\nPolls show McSally trailing Democrat Mark Kelly by large margins in her reelection bid.\nSen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.)\nScott does not face reelection in 2020 but said Friday night that he supports filling the seat now.\n\u201dIt would be irresponsible to allow an extended vacancy on the Supreme Court,\u201d Scott said. \u201dI believe that President Trump's nominee should get a vote in the U.S. Senate.\u201d\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)\nIn 2018, Graham vowed to wait until the next election if an opening on the Supreme Court happened after the primaries. Graham's remarks will likely be a focal point for Democrats in the debate over a new nominee.\n\nVideo: Biden: Next president should fill Ginsburg's seat (Reuters - US Video Online)\n\u201dThis may make you feel better, but I really don't care,\u201d Graham said. \u201dIf an opening comes in the last year of President Trump's term, and the primary process has started, we'll wait until the next election.\u201d\nGraham is locked in an unexpectedly tough race against Democrat Jaime Harrison, who has raised tens of millions of dollars and is running close in the polls in deep red South Carolina.\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine)\nCollins, who is among the most vulnerable GOP senators up for reelection, said earlier this month she would not seat a new Justice in October 2020 or if there's a lame duck and a change of presidents.\n\u201dI think that's too close, I really do,\u201d she said.\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa)\nIn July, Ernst said that she would approve of moving forward with filling a vacancy even in a lame-duck session.\n\u201d(If) it is a lame-duck session, I would support going ahead with any hearings that we might have,\u201d Ernst told PBS in Iowa. \u201dAnd if it comes to an appointment prior to the end of the year, I would be supportive of that.\u201d\nErnst is running for reelection in a state Trump won by 9 points in 2016. However, Democratic nominee Joe Biden is running strong in the polls across the Midwest and Ernst faces a tough challenge against Democrat Theresa Greenfield.\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.)\nLate in 2016, Tillis wrote an op-ed defending the GOP's decision to refuse a hearing for Garland, saying \u201dvoters - not a lame-duck president - should decide the composition of the highest court in the land.\u201d\nTillis is running for reelection against Democrat Cal Cunningham in North Carolina, which along with Florida is among the closest battleground states up for grabs in 2020.\nSen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.)\nGardner, who faces a tough reelection battle in a state Hillary Clinton won in 2016, defended the GOP's decision to deny Garland a hearing.\n\u201dThe next president of the United States should have the opportunity to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court,\u201d Gardner said at the time. \u201dIn 1992, even then-Senator Joe Biden stated the Senate should not hold confirmation hearings for a Supreme Court nominee until after that year's presidential election. Our next election is too soon and the stakes are too high; the American people deserve a role in this process as the next Supreme Court Justice will influence the direction of this country for years to come.\u201d\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska)\nMurkowski said this year that since Republicans denied Garland a hearing in 2016, they should not fill a vacancy in 2020.\n\u201dWhen Republicans held off Merrick Garland it was because nine months prior to the election was too close, we needed to let people decide. And I agreed to do that. If we now say that months prior to the election is OK when nine months was not, that is a double standard and I don't believe we should do it,\u201d she said. \u201dSo I would not support it.\u201d\nSen. John Thune (R-S.D.)\nThune, the second ranking Republican in the Senate, said it is incumbent on the GOP to move ahead with filling the seat.\n\u201dI believe Americans sent a Republican president and a Republican Senate to Washington to ensure we have an impartial judiciary that upholds the Constitution and the rule of law,\u201d Thune said. \u201dWe will fulfill our obligation to them.

It was preceded by some lawyerly language interpreting the previous six years\u2019 worth of electoral politics as proof positive that he had made the proper, fair decisions each step of the way. It\u2019s ignorable. There was a Supreme Court seat open in 2016 that he didn\u2019t want a Democrat to fill, so he kept it open. There is a Supreme Court seat open in 2020 that he wants a Republican to fill, so he\u2019ll try to fill it.\n\u00a9 Provided by Slate\nIn order to do so, he needs 50 Republican votes plus Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s as a tiebreaker.

If Trump wins reelection, that\u2019s the ballgame anyway. If Biden wins?

            "\u00a9 (The Washington Post/The Washington Post via Getty Im) Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died Friday, sparking an immediate political battle. (Nikki Kahn / Washington Post)\nThe death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday turned a theoretical debate over the U.S. Supreme Court into a battle of the highest and most significant political order.\nComing just 46 days before the Nov. 3 presidential election, the passing of the 87-year-old jurist and liberal stalwart ensures the court and its sway over the daily lives of Americans will be a front-and-center campaign issue like no other.\nThe battle lines were clear and immediate.\nDemocrats, stunned and bereft, cited recent precedent and argued that Republicans who control the Senate must hold off approving a successor until voters have the chance to weigh in less than two months from now.\nBut Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the GOP would press ahead with filling the vacancy and vowed to bring President Trump's nominee to a vote on the Senate floor \u2014 though he did not say whether that would come before or after the election.\nTrump was campaigning in Minnesota when Ginsburg's death was announced. As he talked about the next president appointing up to four justices, someone in the crowd shouted, \u201dGinsburg is dead!\u201d Trump didn't seem to hear and kept on talking.\nAfterward, still unaware, he spoke to reporters before boarding Air Force One for a flight home to Washington. \u201dShe just died. Wow. I didn't know that,\u201d Trump said. \u201dShe led an amazing life.\u201d\nLater, Trump praised her in a gracious formal statement.\n\u201cRenowned for her brilliant mind and her powerful dissents at the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg demonstrated that one can disagree without being disagreeable towards one\u2019s colleagues of different points of view,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMay her memory be a great and magnificent blessing to the world.\u201d\nHe said nothing about a possible successor.\nBiden, after landing in Delaware following a day of campaigning in Minnesota, joined other Democrats in insisting there be no selection or vote on a successor before election day.\n\u201dWe should focus on the loss of the justice and her enduring legacy,\u201d he told reporters in Wilmington. \u201cBut there is no doubt \u2014 let me be clear \u2014 that the voters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice for the Senate to consider.\u201d\nGinsburg reportedly made her preference known in the days before her passing. As her strength waned, NPR reported, the justice dictated this statement to her granddaughter Clara Spera: \u201dMy most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\u201d\nIn seeking a delay, Biden and other Democrats cited the precedent set by McConnell in 2016 after conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died suddenly in February of that election year.\nPresident Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a well-regarded federal appeals court judge, but McConnell said voters should have a say in replacing Scalia, and he declined to schedule a vote or even hold hearings on Garland\u2019s nomination. Trump filled the vacancy with conservative appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch after taking office.\n\u201dThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York said on Twitter. \u201dTherefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\nThe leading candidate to replace Ginsburg is Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a former law clerk for Scalia and a long-time law professor at Notre Dame University.\nTrump nominated her to a seat on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago and Trump interviewed her when he was in the process of selecting jurists to replace Scalia and, later, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. White House lawyers said then they expected Barrett would be nominated if Ginsburg died in office.\nThe court consists of five conservative-leaning members and four who are more moderate to liberal. Replacing Ginsburg with another conservative justice could cement a rightward tilt for generations to come, with significant results.\nFor instance, if confirmed Barrett could provide the deciding vote to overturn Roe vs. Wade; she is a conservative who has questioned the legal rationale of the decision legalizing abortion.\nIn a year that has produced an onslaught of the unexpected, Ginsburg's death \u2014 though not altogether surprising, given her age and ill health \u2014 came as a seismic shock. It was the kind of news that stopped people in their tracks, and threw jaws wide open.\nShortly after it was announced, Greg Schultz, a senior advisor to Biden's campaign, tweeted, \u201dTHIS ELECTION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION EVER.\u201d\nHyperbole aside, few in the heat of the moment were inclined to disagree.\n\u201dThe polarization in this election was already a 12 on a 1-10 scale,\u201d said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster. \u201dThis pushes it to about 15.\u201d\nMindful of those stakes, both sides claimed the fight to fill Ginsburg's seat would work to their partisan benefit.\n\u201cAs a political matter this motivates Democrats far more than Republicans,\u201d said Adam Jentleson, an advisor to Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic Senate minority leader during the fight over Garland's nomination. \u201cWe are newly radicalized on judges.\u201d\nBut Republican strategist Alex Conant insisted Trump and the GOP would benefit from what promises to be a fearsome battle, waged from Capitol Hill to the farthest-flung battleground states.\n\u201dA day ago this election was a referendum on Trump and his handling of COVID,\u201d Conant said. \u201dNow it's going to be a referendum on the Supreme Court\u2026. What matters are the independent voters who voted for Trump in 2016 but don't like him. I can't imagine a more vivid reminder of why they voted Republican in the past.\u201d\nDespite recent history, McConnell suggested there was no contradiction in pressing ahead with Ginsburg's replacement.\n\u201dIn the last midterm election before Justice Scalia\u2019s death in 2016, Americans elected a Republican Senate majority because we pledged to check and balance the last days of a lame-duck president\u2019s second term,\u201d he said. \u201dWe kept our promise.\u201d\n\u201dBy contrast, Americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary. Once again, we will keep our promise,\u201d McConnell said.\nHowever, at least two Republicans could break party ranks, complicating McConnell's efforts and Trump's hopes of appointing his third justice to the high court, after Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\nSen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told Alaska Public Media on Friday before Ginsburg died that she would not support a confirming a justice so close to an election.\n\u201cI would not vote to confirm a Supreme Court nominee. We are 50 some days away from an election,\u201d she said, adding that she was using the same justification McConnell used in 2016.\nMaine Sen. Susan Collins, enmeshed in a stiff reelection battle in good part because of her vote to seat Kavanaugh, told the New York Times last month that she would not seat a justice in October, calling it \u201dtoo close\u201d to November's election. She issued a statement Friday night mourning Ginsburg's death but saying nothing about her successor.\nThough several Republicans have said this year that they would hypothetically support moving a nomination before an election, it is unclear whether enough of them will actually do so. McConnell can afford to lose no more than three of his 53 Republicans, which would require Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie.\nOne lawmaker expected to play a high profile role in the political fight is Biden's running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201dIn some of her final moments with her family, she shared her fervent wish to 'not be replaced until a new President is installed,'\u201d Harris said in a written statement. \u201dWe will honor that wish.\u201d\nThe senior Democrat on the committee, which will hold hearings on a Supreme Court nominee, is California's other senator, Dianne Feinstein.\nAs Collins' closely-watched actions suggest, Ginsburg's death will also roil the battle for control of the Senate, putting fresh pressure on Republicans in tough reelection races, including contests in Georgia, North Carolina and Montana.\nRepublican Sen. Joni Ernst, facing a tough reelection fight in Iowa, sent a fundraising email bluntly stating what is likely to be Republicans' argument in the presidential and Senate campaigns this fall.\nWith the subject line, \u201dBREAKING: The future of the Supreme Court is on the line,\u201d the email cited guns, abortion and border policy and said, \u201dIf conservatives fail to protect the White House and the Senate majority in November, we will place the power of the next nominee into the Left's hands.\u201d\nShowing the sensitivity of the matter, Ernst soon retracted the fundraising solicitation and apologized.\n\u201cThis email never should have gone out,\u201d she said in a statement to Radio Iowa. \u201dThough I never saw it, it was sent out under my name and I take responsibility for it. Tonight, my prayers are with the family of Justice Ginsburg.\u201d\nDemocrats were less reticent, touting their fundraising success in the hours after Ginsburg's death was announced. One group alone \u2014 the \u201dGet Mitch Fund\u201d \u2014 reported raising millions in an uphill battle to oust the Senate majority leader, who faces reelection in November.\nBarabak reported from San Francisco and Hook from Portland, Maine.

            "\u00a9 Provided by The LA Times Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed to rapidly move on any Trump nomination to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. (J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press)\nWouldn\u2019t it be nice if Democrats and Republicans could just agree that the fair and right course would be to not replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg until after the presidential inauguration in January? We could simply stick, for now, with the precedent established by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell when he refused to hold a vote on the nomination of Merrick Garland to replace Justice Antonin Scalia.\nAt the time, nearly nine months before the 2016 presidential election, he declared, \u201cThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\u201d\nBut just hours after the announcement of Ginsburg\u2019s death on Friday, McConnell declared, \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d\nThere is little Democrats can do to stop Trump from nominating someone and the Republicans from confirming that person quickly, if that\u2019s what they choose to do. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, and they have eliminated the use of the filibuster in Supreme Court nominations. So the hope must be that four Republican senators \u2014 perhaps those facing tight reelection races \u2014 will have the courage to stand up to their party and refuse to allow a confirmation to be rushed through.\nThat is probably a distant hope. So far, Senate Republicans have shown little inclination to stand up to Trump and McConnell, as was evident in their confirming Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, despite compelling testimony about an alleged sexual assault and perjury \u2014 and despite clear evidence that he lacked judicial temperament. Nor did Republicans demonstrate any independence or courage during the impeachment of Trump.\nThat leaves Democrats with few cards to play at a crucial moment for our democracy. The stakes are enormous. Last term, with Ginsburg on the bench, the court handed down surprising 5-4 decisions to protect individual rights, including a decision to strike down Louisiana\u2019s restrictive abortion law and to invalidate Trump\u2019s recission of the Deferred Action of Childhood Arrival Program. If Ginsburg is replaced by a hard-line conservative who puts politics and feelings ahead of the law, the chance of such rulings will evaporate.\nOn the current court, Chief Justice John Roberts is ideologically in the middle. To be sure, he is to the right of America\u2019s current political center, but at times he joins with the liberals, including in a vote to uphold the Affordable Care Act. If Ginsburg is replaced with someone from the far right, like Judge Amy Coney Barret, who is frequently mentioned as a likely nominee, there will be five justices substantially more conservative than Roberts. There would be virtually no hope that abortion rights could survive such a court, and little chance of checking Trump.\nOne way for Democrats to make clear they will not tolerate Republicans trying to fill this seat in advance of the election would be for them to pledge that, if they take the White House and Senate in November, they will increase the size of the Supreme Court to 13 justices.\nThe number of justices on the court is set by federal law, not the Constitution. Since its beginnings, it has ranged from having between five and 10 members. Since the 1860s, it has remained at nine.\nWhen President Franklin Roosevelt suggested expanding the Supreme Court in the 1930s to overcome court hostility to the New Deal, he was repudiated for trying to pack the court. But the current situation is different. This would be a response to chicanery by Republicans.\nWhat happened with Garland\u2019s nomination was unprecedented, and Democrats rightly believe it was a stolen seat. After Scalia\u2019s death in February 2016, President Obama moved quickly, nominating Garland the next month.\nPrior to that time, there had been 24 Supreme Court vacancies in presidential election years. In 21 instances, the Senate confirmed the nominee and in three instances it did not. But never before had the Senate refused to hold hearings and vote. If Republicans now rapidly confirm a replacement for Ginsburg, an antidote from the Democrats will be necessary.\nThe threat of increasing the size of the court to 13 might be enough to discourage Republicans from their dirty tricks. But if they do it anyway, and the November election produces a Democratic win in the White House and a Democratic majority in the Senate, Congress would be totally justified in increasing the size of the court.\nIt shouldn\u2019t have to come to this. Republicans should be trying to bridge differences rather than inflaming the situation. It is sad that just hours after Ginsburg\u2019s death the focus is on the political machinations rather than her legacy.\nNo other justice in history has become a popular icon in the way she did. She modeled for all of us in how to spend a life working to make society and individual lives better. We only can hope for a new justice in her mold.\nErwin Chemerinsky is dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law and a contributing writer to Opinion.",

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\nConservatives are pushing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell behind the scenes to consider moving to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before the November election, potentially leaving the conference divided over what timeline is best.\nFollowing Ginsburg's death on Friday, McConnell vowed that whomever President Donald Trump nominates to replace the liberal justice will get a vote on the Senate floor, signaling a historic fight in Congress over one of the most polarizing issues in American politics.\nHis statement did not make clear the exact timing of such a fight -- in particular how much of it would happen ahead of or after Election Day.\nUltimately, it will be McConnell's decision and not one that he will make without hearing from members in the coming hours and days.\nRepublican aides across the ideological spectrum point to the importance of Tuesday's conference lunch on Capitol Hill. It will be the first opportunity members will have to hear from their colleagues in-person about the potential political costs of waiting versus acting now.\nFor conservatives in the conference, the thinking is that waiting until after the election leaves too many things to chance: the outcome of the election for one and the risk that some moderates may deem it inappropriate to vote on Trump's nominee in the lame duck session if he loses in November. Conservatives also worry that the Supreme Court may potentially play a pivotal role in the election results if the contest is disputed.\nAnother factor is that Arizona election experts have argued that if Democratic Senate candidate Mark Kelly were to win his race against Sen. Martha McSally, he could potentially be seated at the end of November -- giving McConnell less room for error.\nSenate Republicans only need a simple majority of 51 votes to confirm a new justice once one is formally nominated and there are 53 GOP senators currently. McConnell can only afford to lose three Republicans.\nIf Kelly wins a November 3 special election against McSally, he could be sworn-in as soon as November 30, according to The Arizona Republic, meaning the balance of power in the Senate would shift from the current 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats to 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats.\nRepublicans have the power now and as the old saying goes: when you have the votes, you vote.\n\u201dWhy wait?\u201d one Republican aide asked when pushed on the timeline.\n\u201dThe court is one of the signature accomplishments of the President and this Senate so we need to do all that we can right now,\u201d another GOP aide told CNN.\nSen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, told Fox News just hours after the news of Ginsburg's death broke Friday, \u201dI believe that the President should next week nominee a successor to the court, and I think it is critical that the Senate takes up and confirms that successor before Election Day.\u201d\nThe political Rubik's cube is infinitely complicated for McConnell, however, who must balance the wishes of conservatives looking to move rapidly with the concerns of some moderate Republicans, who would have to face voters weeks or even days after a contentious Supreme Court fight.\nBut Republican aides warn that the calculus won't be the same for every member up for reelection.\nFor some, motivating their conservative base around a Supreme Court fight may help solidify their support.\nAlready, Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina up in November, has made it clear he stands ready to support Trump's nominee -- though none has been named yet.\n\u201dThere is a clear choice on the future of the Supreme Court between the well-qualified and conservative jurist President Trump will nominate and I will support, and the liberal activist Joe Biden will nominate and Cal Cunningham will support, who will legislate radical, left-wing policies from the bench,\u201d Tillis said.\nTrump wrote on Twitter Saturday that Republicans have an \u201dobligation\u201d to fill Ginsburg's vacant seat on the Supreme Court \u201dwithout delay.\u201d",
            "\u00a9 Getty Images Vulnerable GOP incumbents embrace filling Supreme Court seat this year\nSeveral vulnerable Republican senators facing tough election battles in November are quickly coming out in support of filling the Supreme Court vacancy this year left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\nGinsburg's death injects a fresh round of chaos into what was already a historic year in which both control of the Senate and the White House are up for grabs, with Republicans playing defense in several key battleground states with less than 50 days until the November election.\nFour Republican senators thus far in key races have come out in support of filling the seat, aligning themselves closely with President Trump on an issue that will electrify the GOP base.\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is fighting for a fourth term, became the latest Republican senator on the ballot in November to signal support for filling the Supreme Court seat this year.\nGraham pointed to recent statements he's made saying that he would back the filling of a vacancy in 2020 before the election.\n\u201dAfter Kavanaugh, the rules have changed as far as I'm concerned,\u201d Graham said in an August article he highlighted, apparently referencing the acrimony over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation in 2018.\nHe also retweeted Trump's call for Republicans to move quickly, adding, \u201dI fully understand where President @realDonaldTrump is coming from.\u201d\nGraham faces an increasingly formidable opponent in the race for South Carolina's Senate seat in Democratic candidate Jaime Harrison. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted this month showed the two tied at 48 percent. Just a day after the race, Harrison reported raising $1 million in 24 hours after the poll results were announced.\nThe Democratic Senate campaign fundraising arm has also thrown a large sum of money behind Harrison's bid.\nHowever, Graham is still favored to win his race in November.\nGraham's support for moving a nominee this year is significant because of his role atop the Judiciary Committee, where he'll be responsible for deciding if the nominee gets a hearing and shepherding the nomination to the Senate floor.\nIn addition to Graham, Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) and Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) have each endorsed moving to fill the vacancy this year.\nTillis, like Graham, is a member of the Judiciary Committee, meaning he'll have an early vote in the confirmation process and will question whomever Trump nominates during the high-profile hearings.\nTillis immediately sought to paint his race against Democratic nominee Cal Cunningham as a referendum on the Supreme Court, an issue that Republicans believe animates their supporters and could help drive voter turnout at the polls in November.\n\u201dPresident Trump is again facing voters at the ballot box and North Carolinians will ultimately render their judgment on his presidency and how he chooses to fill the vacancy,\u201d Tillis said.\n\u201dThere is a clear choice on the future of the Supreme Court between the well-qualified and conservative jurist President Trump will nominate and I will support, and the liberal activist Joe Biden will nominate and Cal Cunningham will support, who will legislate radical, left-wing policies from the bench,\u201d he added.\nNeither Loeffler nor McSally is on the Judiciary Committee, but they were both appointed to their seats and are fighting to win election to the Senate for the first time. McSally previously ran in 2018 but lost.\nLoeffler became the first GOP senator to explicitly call for the seat to be filled this year. She doubled down on Saturday and pointed to the looming fight over the Supreme Court as symbolic of the decision facing voters in November.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \u201dhas said that we will have a vote on the Senate floor on this, and I completely support that,\u201d Loeffler said during an interview with Fox News.\nShe added that the Supreme Court battle \u201dis just as big as\u201d the economy or the coronavirus because it highlights differences between the parties.\n\u201dThat's why it's vitally important that we keep the Senate and re-elect President Trump,\u201d she added.\nLoeffler and McSally face different political challenges.\nLoeffler is trying to fight off a challenge from fellow a Republican, Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.). The Cook Political Report rates the Georgia special election as leaning toward Republicans.\nMeanwhile, McSally is trying to defeat Democratic nominee Mark Kelly in a race that political handicappers believe leans Democrat.\nThe support by Tillis and McSally to fill the seat comes as recent polls have shown that voters in their states trust Democratic nominee Joe Biden more than Trump to fill the seat.\nVoters in Arizona, according to a poll from The New York Times and Siena College, say they trust Biden over Trump 53 percent to 43 percent to \u201ddo a better job\u201d at picking a Supreme Court justice.\nTillis faces a voter base where Biden's advantage on choosing a Supreme Court justice is narrower, but he still leads Trump 47 percent to 44 percent in North Carolina, according to the poll.\nEven as the four GOP senators raced to support filling the seat, many of their GOP colleagues in their own tough reelection bids have sidestepped the issue.\nSens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) both released statements remembering Ginsburg but did not address if the Senate should vote to fill her seat this year.\nCollins and Gardner are the only two Republican senators running for reelection in states won by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016.\nFormer Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, the party's Democratic Senate nominee, is calling for a nominee to replace Ginsburg to be delayed until next year.\n\u201dThe Senate must not confirm a new Supreme Court Justice until after a new President is sworn in next year. Senator Gardner must uphold the commitment he set more than four years ago and allow the President elected in November to make this decision,\u201d he said in a tweet.\nThough Gardner is viewed as more vulnerable than Collins, she has drawn more scrutiny over her votes on judicial nominees, including the 2018 fight over then-nominee Kavanaugh.\nThe Times-Siena poll found that 38 percent of Maine voters approve of Collins's vote, compared with 55 percent who disapprove.\nFifty-nine percent of voters in Maine also said they trust Biden to pick a justice, compared with 37 percent who support Trump.\nThough Collins did not address the issue during her statement on Friday night, she indicated to The New York Times earlier this month that she could not support confirming a nominee before the election.\n\u201dI think that's too close, I really do,\u201d she said.\nUpdated 3:21 p.m.",

Lindsey Graham said he will support President Trump\u2019s effort to forge ahead with a replacement for Ruth Bader Ginsburg ahead of the election, which is less than two months away.\nThe South Carolina Republican, who chairs the Judiciary Committee that holds confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominees, made the announcement over Twitter and cited past actions by Democrats as justification for his decision.\n\u201cThe two biggest changes regarding the Senate and judicial confirmations that have occurred in the last decade have come from Democrats,\u201d Graham said.\nHe pointed out that then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada invoked the \u201cnuclear option\u201d in 2013, which made it so that only a simple majority vote was needed to overcome a filibuster for executive appointments and judicial nominees (but not for the Supreme Court), instead of the 60-vote super majority as was previous practice. Republicans then abolished the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees in 2017, leading to what is now a simple majority vote to confirm new justices.\nGraham also took aim at the confirmation process for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, which lasted a lengthy 89 days and was fraught with controversy after accusations of sexual assault surfaced.\n\u201cChuck Schumer and his friends in the liberal media conspired to destroy the life of Brett Kavanaugh and hold that Supreme Court seat open,\u201d Graham said.\n\u201cIn light of these two events, I will support President @realDonaldTrump in any effort to move forward regarding the recent vacancy created by the passing of Justice Ginsburg,\u201d he added.\nThe remarks come after a video of Graham from four years ago resurfaced on social media after Ginsburg\u2019s death. In the clip he said he would not support moving forward a nominee before the 2016 election.

            "\u00a9 Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press\nWASHINGTON\u2014A handful of moderate and institutionalist Senate Republicans were thrust into the spotlight Friday after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) to say that he would seek to confirm President Trump\u2019s nominee to replace her on the Supreme Court.\nThe Senate\u2019s Republicans control 53 votes compared with 47 for the Democrats, giving them enough power to muscle through a Trump nominee. Because Vice President Mike Pence can break any ties, Democrats would need to peel off four Republicans to block Mr. Trump\u2019s pick, a difficult goal to meet given the small number of moderate Republicans in the chamber.\nDespite having blocked President Obama\u2019s high-court pick during an election year, Mr. McConnell suggested in his statement Friday that the current situation was different from 2016 because the Senate and White House were controlled by the same party.\n\u201cAmericans re-elected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cOnce again, we will keep our promise. President Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Friday night that Justice Ginsburg shouldn\u2019t be replaced until the next president is in office.\n\u201cThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in a tweet Friday night, echoing precisely what Mr. McConnell said after the 2016 vacancy. \u201cTherefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\u201d\nIf Senate GOP leaders begin consideration of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee, moderate Republican senators including Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska will likely be the final deciders on whether the president\u2019s pick clears the chamber.\nMs. Murkowski has said previously that she wouldn\u2019t support filling a Supreme Court vacancy this year.\nMr. Trump\u2019s shortlist of potential Supreme Court nominees includes three Republican senators\u2014Josh Hawley of Missouri, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas. Also on the list: several of his own appointees to the appellate courts, as well as two former solicitors general, a state attorney general, a deputy counsel to Mr. Trump and the U.S. ambassador to Mexico.\nDemocrats were furious with Mr. McConnell for blocking Merrick Garland, whom Mr. Obama, a Democrat, tapped for the Supreme Court following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016.\nAfter Mr. Trump took office in 2017, the Senate confirmed his nominee to succeed Mr. Scalia, Neil Gorsuch, following a 14-month vacancy. The Senate confirmed Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for another Supreme Court vacancy in 2018.\nEven before Mr. Obama nominated Mr. Garland, Senate Republicans said in February 2016 they wouldn\u2019t hold Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings for his pick, saying that the choice should be left to the voters that fall. Mr. McConnell reiterated Friday that the dynamic was different when the Senate and White House are controlled by the same party. Democrats have said the explanation is hypocritical.\nHistory shows the Senate has usually confirmed Supreme Court justices in an election year near the end of a presidential term, but those cases are rare, and most occurred before the current era of deep partisan divides over judicial appointments.\nAnnouncing the names of potential high-court nominees is a strategy Mr. Trump first deployed during the 2016 campaign and is credited with boosting his support among conservatives. With control of the Senate now in play in November, the vacancy will likely energize base voters in both parties.\nRepublican campaign strategist Alex Conant said the political implications of Mr. Trump\u2019s pick would depend in part on who he chooses and how well the White House vets its candidate.\n\u201cBut overall it\u2019s hard to see how this doesn\u2019t help Republicans politically,\u201d Mr. Conant said. It \u201creally helps the Senate GOP because it puts Dems running in red states in a terrible position, and helps Trump make the election about something other than himself.\u201d\nDemocrats said the nomination fight would motivate their voters in Senate contests, including their effort in South Carolina to oust Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham.\n\u201cHere in South Carolina and across the country, women will determine the outcome of November 3rd,\u201d Lauren Harper, a Democratic strategist who is a spokeswoman for the \u201cLindsey Must Go\u201d super PAC, said in a statement. \u201cHe should be absolutely terrified of the power of the women here.\u201d\nMr. Graham released a statement Friday offering his condolences on the occasion of Justice Ginsburg\u2019s death but didn\u2019t comment on how he would handle a nominee to replace her.\nWrite to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com",

He added: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d\nAD\nAD\nIn early 2016, McConnell said he would not give Merrick Garland his confirmation proceedings because, he argued, voters should get to decide through the presidential election. He has repeatedly reversed his own standard and said he would fill a vacancy under Trump, even in an election year.\nHis intent to move ahead came despite Ginsburg\u2019s dying wish. In a posthumous statement released to NPR, Ginsburg said: \u201cMy most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\u201d\nMcConnell has rationalized his decision by saying the standards were different because the White House and the Senate were controlled by different parties in 2016, which is not the case this year.\nAD\nBut at least two GOP senators indicated in interviews before Ginsburg\u2019s death that they would not support filling a Supreme Court vacancy so close to Election Day, pledging to uphold the standard crafted by McConnell that most Senate Republicans adhered to in 2016.\nAD\nAnd in Arizona, where Democrat Mark Kelly has consistently been favored over incumbent GOP Sen. Martha McSally, the winner may be sworn into his or her term during the lame-duck session, altering the current 53-47 Republican control of the Senate if Kelly does prevail on Nov. 3.\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a perennial swing vote on contentious confirmation fights, told the New York Times earlier this month that she would not support voting to confirm a new justice in October, saying, \u201cI think that\u2019s too close, I really do.\u201d Collins, who came under considerable scrutiny after supporting Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s 2018 nomination to the Supreme Court, is considered one of the most vulnerable Republican incumbents on the ballot this fall.\nAD\nAnd in an interview with Alaska Public Media that occurred Friday ahead of the news of Ginsburg\u2019s death, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) \u2014 another consistent swing vote \u2014 said she would not vote to confirm a justice before the election, either.\nAD\n\u201cI would not vote to confirm a Supreme Court nominee,\u201d Murkowski said in the interview with Alaska Public Media. \u201cWe are 50-some days away from an election.\u201d Aides to both women declined to confirm those remarks after the news of Ginsburg\u2019s death.\nIn his statement Friday, McConnell pointedly did not lay out a timetable for the confirmation vote, namely whether he would try to hold it before the Nov. 3 elections or whether it would be in the final weeks of the year, before the swearing-in of a new Senate in January. And it is far from clear whether McConnell would be able to muscle through Ginsburg\u2019s successor before the election.\nAD\nMcConnell circulated a letter among GOP senators late Friday, urging them all to \u201cbe cautious and keep your powder dry\u201d on whether the Senate should process a nominee until Republicans return to Washington.\nAD\n\u201cFor those of you who are unsure how to answer, or for those inclined to oppose giving a nominee a vote, I urge you all to keep your powder dry,\u201d McConnell wrote in the letter, obtained by The Washington Post. \u201cThis is not the time to prematurely lock yourselves into a position you may later regret.\u201d\nDemocrats were quick to jump on McConnell\u2019s reversal from four years ago, as they pointed to McConnell\u2019s reasoning in 2016 to hold up Obama\u2019s final nominee to the Supreme Court.\nAD\n\u201cThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. \u201cTherefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\u201d That was precisely the same statement issued by McConnell on Feb. 13, 2016, shortly after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.\nAD\nDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden also warned the Republican-controlled Senate not to hold an election-year confirmation vote to fill Ginsburg\u2019s seat.\n\u201cThere is no doubt \u2014 let me be clear \u2014 that the voter should pick the president and the president should pick the justice for the Senate to consider,\u201d Biden told reporters in a hastily arranged appearance late Friday.\nAD\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a close Trump ally who is up for reelection this fall, said nothing about a timeline for holding confirmation proceedings for Ginsburg\u2019s successor in his statement Friday evening.\n\u201cJustice Ginsburg was a trailblazer who possessed tremendous passion for her causes. She served with honor and distinction as a member of the Supreme Court,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWhile I had many differences with her on legal philosophy, I appreciate her service to our nation.\u201d\nAD\nIn the past, Graham himself has said he would not support processing a nominee in a year when Trump was on the ballot.\n\u201cIf an opening comes in the last year of President Trump\u2019s term, and the primary process has started, we\u2019ll wait to the next election,\u201d Graham said at an event hosted by the Atlantic magazine in October 2018. He made similar remarks in March 2016, when he said if a Republican was elected later that year and a vacancy occurred in the last year of their first term, \u201cyou can say, \u2018Lindsey Graham said let\u2019s let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination.\u2019 \u201d\nAD\nGinsburg\u2019s death took the already contentious fight for control of the Senate to yet another level.\nVulnerable senators in key Senate races are likely to come under significant scrutiny on the Supreme Court, with the 2020 election certain to turn into a referendum on which party that voters want to nominate and confirm the liberal justice\u2019s successor.\nAD\nRepublicans who decide to stand with McConnell on filling the vacancy are certain to be challenged about what they said in 2016 in blocking consideration of Obama\u2019s choice.\n\u201cNo Supreme Court nominee should be considered by the Senate before the next president is sworn into office,\u201d Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) said on the Senate floor in 2016.\nAD\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) also said that year that voters should have a say.\n\u201cThis is about the fact that we have a president who is moving out of his residency and we have a very, very significant election coming up where we want the people to speak out. We want to hear their opinion on this. They will do that by electing a new president,\u201d Ernst said.\nBoth senators face tough reelection bids.\nDemand Justice, a liberal advocacy group created during the Trump presidency to boost Democratic involvement in the judiciary, plans to launch a $10 million ad campaign in an effort to ensure the seat does not get filled until after Inauguration Day 2021, according to an official familiar with the plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy.\nAD\nSome Republican senators in closely watched races said Friday night that this Senate should go ahead and work to confirm Trump\u2019s nominee this year.\nSen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), who is facing not only a Democratic challenger but GOP Rep. Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.) in Georgia\u2019s top-two Senate election process this year, said she would support Trump \u201cin nominating a strict constructionist before the election.\u201d\n\u201cThis U.S. Senate should vote on President Trump\u2019s next nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d tweeted McSally, another one of the most vulnerable Republican incumbents this fall.\nBoth women have not been elected to the Senate outright, instead appointed to their seats. Republicans are still favored to hold onto Loeffler\u2019s seat, but a Kelly win in Arizona could have significant implications for confirming a nominee in a lame-duck session.\nBecause Kelly would fill an existing term, the Democrat could be eligible to fill the seat that was held by Republican John McCain as early as Nov. 30, according to Republican and Democratic elections lawyers who spoke to the Arizona Republic. A spokesman for Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, did not return a request for comment or clarification Friday evening.\nOn average, it has taken nearly 70 days to confirm a Supreme Court justice in the Senate, according to a 2018 report from the Congressional Research Service.",
            "The death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday turned a theoretical debate over the U.S. Supreme Court into a battle of the highest and most significant political order.\nComing just 46 days before the Nov. 3 presidential election, the passing of the 87-year-old jurist and liberal stalwart ensures the court and its sway over the daily lives of Americans will be a front-and-center campaign issue like no other.\n\nFor the record: A previous version of this story said Harry Reid was Democratic Senate majority leader during the fight over Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination. He was Senate minority leader.\nThe battle lines were clear and immediate.\nDemocrats, stunned and bereft, cited recent precedent and argued that Republicans who control the Senate must hold off approving a successor until voters have the chance to weigh in less than two months from now.\nAdvertisement\nBut Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the GOP would press ahead with filling the vacancy and vowed to bring President Trump\u2019s nominee to a vote on the Senate floor \u2014 though he did not say whether that would come before or after the election.\nTrump was campaigning in Minnesota when Ginsburg\u2019s death was announced. As he talked about the next president appointing up to four justices, someone in the crowd shouted, \u201cGinsburg is dead!\u201d Trump didn\u2019t seem to hear and kept on talking.\nAfterward, still unaware, he spoke to reporters before boarding Air Force One for a flight home to Washington. \u201cShe just died. Wow. I didn\u2019t know that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe led an amazing life.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nLater, Trump praised her in a gracious formal statement.\n\u201cRenowned for her brilliant mind and her powerful dissents at the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg demonstrated that one can disagree without being disagreeable towards one\u2019s colleagues of different points of view,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMay her memory be a great and magnificent blessing to the world.\u201d\nHe said nothing about a possible successor.\nBiden, after landing in Delaware following a day of campaigning in Minnesota, joined other Democrats in insisting there be no selection or vote on a successor before election day.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe should focus on the loss of the justice and her enduring legacy,\u201d he told reporters in Wilmington. \u201cBut there is no doubt \u2014 let me be clear \u2014 that the voters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice for the Senate to consider.\u201d\nGinsburg reportedly made her preference known in the days before her passing. As her strength waned, NPR reported, the justice dictated this statement to her granddaughter Clara Spera: \u201cMy most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\u201d\nIn seeking a delay, Biden and other Democrats cited the precedent set by McConnell in 2016 after conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died suddenly in February of that election year.\nPresident Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a well-regarded federal appeals court judge, but McConnell said voters should have a say in replacing Scalia, and he declined to schedule a vote or even hold hearings on Garland\u2019s nomination. Trump filled the vacancy with conservative appeals court judge Neil M. Gorsuch after taking office.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York said on Twitter. \u201cTherefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\u201d\nThe leading candidate to replace Ginsburg is U.S. Circuit Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a former law clerk for Scalia and a longtime law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\nTrump nominated her to a seat on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago and had previously interviewed her when he was in the process of selecting jurists to replace Scalia and, later, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. White House lawyers said then that they expected Barrett would be nominated if Ginsburg were to die in office.\nThe Supreme Court consists of five conservative-leaning members and four who are more moderate to liberal. Replacing Ginsburg with another conservative justice could cement a rightward tilt for generations to come, with significant results.\nAdvertisement\nIn a year that has produced an onslaught of the unexpected, Ginsburg\u2019s death \u2014 though not altogether surprising, given her age and ill health \u2014 came as a seismic shock. It was the kind of news that stopped people in their tracks and threw jaws wide open.\nShortly after it was announced, Greg Schultz, a senior advisor to Biden\u2019s campaign, tweeted, \u201cTHIS ELECTION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION EVER.\u201d\nHyperbole aside, few in the heat of the moment were inclined to disagree.\n\u201cThe polarization in this election was already a 12 on a 1-to-10 scale,\u201d said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster. \u201cThis pushes it to about 15.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMindful of those stakes, both sides claimed the fight to fill Ginsburg\u2019s seat would work to their partisan benefit.\n\u201cAs a political matter this motivates Democrats far more than Republicans,\u201d said Adam Jentleson, an advisor to former Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic minority leader during the fight over Garland\u2019s nomination. \u201cWe are newly radicalized on judges.\u201d\nBut Republican strategist Alex Conant insisted Trump and the GOP would benefit from what promises to be a fearsome battle, waged from Capitol Hill to the farthest-flung battleground states.\n\u201cA day ago this election was a referendum on Trump and his handling of COVID,\u201d Conant said. \u201cNow it\u2019s going to be a referendum on the Supreme Court.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nDespite recent history, McConnell suggested there was no contradiction in pressing ahead with Ginsburg\u2019s replacement.\n\u201cIn the last midterm election before Justice Scalia\u2019s death in 2016, Americans elected a Republican Senate majority because we pledged to check and balance the last days of a lame-duck president\u2019s second term,\u201d he said. \u201cWe kept our promise.\u201d\n\u201cBy contrast, Americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary. Once again, we will keep our promise,\u201d McConnell said.\nHowever, at least two Republicans could break party ranks, complicating McConnell\u2019s efforts and Trump\u2019s hopes of appointing his third justice to the high court, after Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh.\nAdvertisement\nSen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told Alaska Public Media on Friday before Ginsburg died that she would not support confirming a justice so close to an election.\n\u201cI would not vote to confirm a Supreme Court nominee. We are 50-some days away from an election,\u201d she said, adding that she was using the same justification McConnell used in 2016.\nMaine Sen. Susan Collins, enmeshed in a stiff reelection battle in good part because of her vote to seat Kavanaugh, told the New York Times last month that she would not seat a justice in October, calling it \u201ctoo close\u201d to November\u2019s election. She issued a statement Friday night mourning Ginsburg\u2019s death but saying nothing about her potential successor.\nThough several Republicans have said this year that they would hypothetically support moving a nomination before an election, it is unclear whether enough of them will actually do so.\nAdvertisement\nMcConnell can afford to lose no more than three of his 53 Republicans, which would require Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie.\nOne lawmaker expected to play a high-profile role in the political fight is Biden\u2019s running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nThe senior Democrat on the committee, which will hold hearings on a Supreme Court nominee, is California\u2019s other senator, Dianne Feinstein.\nAdvertisement\nAs Collins\u2019 closely watched actions suggest, Ginsburg\u2019s death will also roil the battle for control of the Senate, putting fresh pressure on Republicans in tough reelection races, including contests in Georgia, North Carolina and Montana.\nRepublican Sen. Joni Ernst, facing a difficult reelection fight in Iowa, sent a fundraising email bluntly stating what is likely to be Republicans\u2019 argument in the presidential and Senate campaigns this fall.\nWith the subject line, \u201cBREAKING: The future of the Supreme Court is on the line,\u201d the email cited guns, abortion and border policy and said, \u201cIf conservatives fail to protect the White House and the Senate majority in November, we will place the power of the next nominee into the Left\u2019s hands.\u201d\nShowing the sensitivity of the matter, Ernst soon retracted the fundraising solicitation and apologized.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThis email never should have gone out,\u201d she said in a statement to Radio Iowa. \u201cThough I never saw it, it was sent out under my name and I take responsibility for it.

            "The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg just over six weeks before the election cast an immediate spotlight on the high court vacancy, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell quickly vowing to bring to a vote whoever President Donald Trump nominates.\nMcConnell, in a statement just over an hour after Ginsburg\u2019s death was announced, declared unequivocally that Trump\u2019s nominee would receive a vote, even though he had stalled President Barack Obama\u2019s choice for months ahead of the 2016 election, eventually preventing a vote.\nTrump, in brief remarks to reporters after learning of her death, called Ginsburg \u201can amazing woman,\u201d adding that \u201cshe led an amazing life.\u201d He had continued with a campaign speech for about an hour after the nation learned of her death, and said later he had been unaware.\nHe had boasted in the speech that the next presidential term could offer him as many as four appointments to the nine-member court, whose members are confirmed for life.\nAdvertisement\nGinsburg\u2019s death could significantly affect the presidential race, further stirring passions in the deeply divided nation as the campaign pushes into its stretch run.\nTrump took the stage for a Minnesota rally not long before Ginsburg\u2019s death was announced. He spoke for more than 90 minutes, never mentioning it, apparently not alerted to the development. He spoke to reporters about her passing as he boarded Air Force One to return to Washington.\nBut he did say in his speech that whoever is elected in November will have the ability to potentially fill several Supreme vacancies, declaring, \u201cThis is going to be the most important election in the history of our country and we have to get it right.\u201d\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden, returning to Delaware from his own campaign stop in Minnesota, praised Ginsburg upon his arrival.\nAdvertisement\nGinsburg was \u201cnot only a giant of the legal profession but a beloved figure,\u201d he said. She \u201cstood for all of us.\u201d\nA confirmation vote in the Senate is not guaranteed, even with a Republican majority.\nTypically it takes several months to vet and hold hearings on a Supreme Court nominee, and time is short ahead of the election.\nKey senators may be reluctant to cast votes so close to the election. With a slim GOP majority, 53 seats in the 100-member chamber, Trump\u2019s choice could afford to lose only a few.\nAdvertisement\nMcConnell did not specify the timing, but pushing a confirmation off to the post-election lame-duck session would carry other complications, including the political tangle of trying to push it through in the final weeks of the year after voters have decided control of the White House and control of the Senate.\nTrump has made appointments to the federal judiciary, including two Supreme Court justices, part of his legacy and said last month that he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d try to fill a vacancy on the high court if one came up before the end of his first term.\n\u201cAbsolutely, I\u2019d do it,\u201d Trump said in an August 11 interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. \u201cI would move quickly.

            "McConnell, who sets the calendar in the U.S. Senate and has made judicial appointments his priority, declared unequivocally in a statement not long after Ginsburg\u2019s death was announced that Trump\u2019s nominee would receive a confirmation vote in the chamber. In 2016, McConnell refused to consider President Barack Obama\u2019s choice for the high court months ahead of the election, eventually preventing a vote.\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden vigorously disagreed, declaring that \u201cvoters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice to consider.\u201d\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg just six weeks before the election cast an immediate spotlight on the crucial high court vacancy, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell quickly vowing to bring to a vote whoever President Donald Trump nominates.\nAdvertisement\nThe impending clash over the vacant seat \u2014 when to fill it and with whom \u2014 is sure to significantly affect the stretch run of the presidential race, further stirring passions in a nation already reeling from the pandemic that has killed nearly 200,000 people, left millions unemployed and heightened partisan tensions and anger.\nTrump, in brief remarks to reporters after learning of Ginsburg\u2019s death, called her \u201can amazing woman who led an amazing life.\u201d He had continued with a campaign speech in Minnesota for about an hour and a half after the nation \u2014 as well as aides and many in his audience with cell phones \u2014 had learned of her death. He seemed surprised when he spoke with reporters afterward, saying he did not know she had died.\nTrump had noted in his rally speech that the next presidential term could offer him as many as four appointments to the nine-member court, whose members are confirmed for life. \u201cThis is going to be the most important election in the history of our country and we have to get it right,\u201d he added.\nAdvertisement\nBiden, returning to Delaware from his own campaign stop in Minnesota, praised Ginsburg upon his arrival.\nShe was \u201cnot only a giant of the legal profession but a beloved figure,\u201d he said. She \u201cstood for all of us.\u201d\nIt must be up to the next president, whether himself or Trump, to choose a successor to be submitted for Senate confirmation, Biden said.\n\u201cThis was the position that the Republican Senate took in 2016, when there were nearly nine months before the election,\u201d he said. \u201dThat is the position the United States Senate must take now, when the election is less than two months away. We are talking about the Constitution and the Supreme Court. That institution should not be subject to politics.\nA confirmation vote in the Senate is not guaranteed, even with a Republican majority.\nTypically it takes several months to vet and hold hearings on a Supreme Court nominee, and time is short ahead of the election. Key senators may be reluctant to cast votes so close to the election. With a slim GOP majority, 53 seats in the 100-member chamber, Trump\u2019s choice could afford to lose only a few.\nMcConnell did not specify the timing, but trying for confirmation in a post-election lame-duck session if Trump had lost to Biden or Republicans had lost the Senate would carry further political complications.\nDemocrats immediate denounced McConnell\u2019s move as hypocritical, pointing out that he refused to call hearings for Merrick Garland, Obama\u2019s pick, 237 days before the 2016 election. The 2020 election is 46 days away.\nAdvertisement\nSenate Democratic leader Charles Schumer, in a tweet, echoed word for word what McConnell said in 2016 about the Garland nomination: \u201cThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\u201d\nBoth Trump and McConnell have pointed to appointments to the federal judiciary, including two Supreme Court justices, part of their legacy. Trump said last month that he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d try to fill a vacancy if one came up before the end of his first term.\n\u201dI would move quickly, \u201d Trump said in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. \u201cWhy not? I mean, they would. The Democrats would if they were in this position.\u201d\nWhile plans were still being formalized, Trump was expected to announce a choice sooner rather than later and may meet with members of his short list in coming days, according to a White House official not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations.\nTrump last week added 20 names to his list of candidates he\u2019s pledged to choose from if he has future vacancies to fill. He contrasted his list with unnamed \u201cradical justices\u201d he claimed Biden would nominate who would \u201cfundamentally transform America without a single vote of Congress.\u201d\nTrump released a similar list in 2016 in a bid to win over conservative and evangelical voters who had doubts about his conservative credentials. Among those on his current list: Sens. Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton, former Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Chicago, long a favorite of conservatives.\nAdvertisement\nThe average number of days to confirm a justice, according to the Congressional Research Service, is 69, which would be after the election. But some Republicans quickly noted that Ginsburg was confirmed in just 42 days.\nFour GOP defections could defeat a nomination, while a tie vote could be broken by Vice President Mike Pence.\nAmong the senators to watch are Republicans Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah and others.\nCollins is in a tight race for her own reelection, as are several other GOP senators, including Cory Gardner in Colorado. Murkowski and Romney have been critical of Trump and protective of the institution of the Senate.\nSome Republicans, including Collins and Murkowski, have suggested previously that hearings should wait if a seat were to open. And because the Arizona Senate race is a special election, that seat could be filled as early as November 30 \u2014 which would narrow the window for McConnell if the Democratic candidate, Mark Kelly, hangs onto his lead.\nUnder McConnell, the Senate changed the confirmation rules to allow for a simple majority. The Senate\u2019s No. 2 Republican, Sen. John Thune, supported McConnell\u2019s plan Friday night, though the Judiciary Commitee chairman, Lindsey Graham, did not weigh in.\nAdvertisement\nAs a mourning crowd gathered outside the Supreme Court and tributes poured in, Obama hailed Ginsburg\u2019s life and called for Republicans to wait, saying \u201ca basic principle of the law \u2013 and of everyday fairness \u2013 is that we apply rules with consistency and not based on what\u2019s convenient or advantageous in the moment.\u201d\nOne difference from 2016 is that, despite the vacancy resulting from Ginsburg\u2019s death, conservatives have a working majority of five justices on a range of issues. When Antonin Scalia died four years ago, the court was divided between four liberals and four conservatives.\nHowever, the next pick could shape important decisions, including on abortion rights, as well as any legal challenges that may stem from the 2020 election. The 2018 hearings on Trump\u2019s second pick, now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh, turned into a bitter partisan battle after sexual assault allegations were made.\nBiden has promised to nominate a Black woman to the high court if given the chance.

            "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died Friday, sparking an immediate political battle. (Nikki Kahn / Washington Post)\nThe death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday turned a theoretical debate over the U.S. Supreme Court into a battle of the highest and most significant political order.\nComing just 46 days before the Nov. 3 presidential election, the passing of the 87-year-old jurist and liberal stalwart ensures the court and its sway over the daily lives of Americans will be a front-and-center campaign issue like no other.\nThe battle lines were clear and immediate.\nDemocrats, stunned and bereft, cited recent precedent and argued that Republicans who control the Senate must hold off approving a successor until voters have the chance to weigh in less than two months from now.\nBut Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the GOP would press ahead with filling the vacancy and vowed to bring President Trump's nominee to a vote on the Senate floor \u2014 though he did not say whether that would come before or after the election.\nTrump was campaigning in Minnesota when Ginsburg\u2019s death was announced. As he talked about the next president appointing up to four justices, someone in the crowd shouted, \u201cGinsburg is dead!\u201d Trump didn\u2019t seem to hear and kept on talking.\nAfterward, still unaware, he spoke to reporters before boarding Air Force One for a flight home to Washington. \u201cShe just died. Wow. I didn\u2019t know that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe led an amazing life.\u201d\nLater, Trump praised her in a gracious formal statement.\n\u201cRenowned for her brilliant mind and her powerful dissents at the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg demonstrated that one can disagree without being disagreeable towards one\u2019s colleagues of different points of view,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMay her memory be a great and magnificent blessing to the world.\u201d\nHe said nothing about a possible successor.\nBiden, after landing in Delaware following a day of campaigning in Minnesota, joined other Democrats in insisting there be no selection or vote on a successor before election day.\n\u201cWe should focus on the loss of the justice and her enduring legacy,\u201d he told reporters in Wilmington. \u201cBut there is no doubt \u2014 let me be clear \u2014 that the voters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice for the Senate to consider.\u201d\nStory continues\nGinsburg reportedly made her preference known in the days before her passing. As her strength waned, NPR reported, the justice dictated this statement to her granddaughter Clara Spera: \u201cMy most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\u201d\nIn seeking a delay, Biden and other Democrats cited the precedent set by McConnell in 2016 after conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died suddenly in February of that election year.\nPresident Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a well-regarded federal appeals court judge, but McConnell said voters should have a say in replacing Scalia, and he declined to schedule a vote or even hold hearings on Garland\u2019s nomination. Trump filled the vacancy with conservative appeals court judge Neil M. Gorsuch after taking office.\n\u201cThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York said on Twitter. \u201cTherefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\u201d\nThe leading candidate to replace Ginsburg is U.S. Circuit Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a former law clerk for Scalia and a longtime law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\nTrump nominated her to a seat on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago and had previously interviewed her when he was in the process of selecting jurists to replace Scalia and, later, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. White House lawyers said then that they expected Barrett would be nominated if Ginsburg were to die in office.\nThe Supreme Court consists of five conservative-leaning members and four who are more moderate to liberal. Replacing Ginsburg with another conservative justice could cement a rightward tilt for generations to come, with significant results.\nIn a year that has produced an onslaught of the unexpected, Ginsburg\u2019s death \u2014 though not altogether surprising, given her age and ill health \u2014 came as a seismic shock. It was the kind of news that stopped people in their tracks and threw jaws wide open.\nShortly after it was announced, Greg Schultz, a senior advisor to Biden\u2019s campaign, tweeted, \u201cTHIS ELECTION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION EVER.\u201d\nHyperbole aside, few in the heat of the moment were inclined to disagree.\n\u201cThe polarization in this election was already a 12 on a 1-to-10 scale,\u201d said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster. \u201cThis pushes it to about 15.\u201d\nMindful of those stakes, both sides claimed the fight to fill Ginsburg\u2019s seat would work to their partisan benefit.\n\u201cAs a political matter this motivates Democrats far more than Republicans,\u201d said Adam Jentleson, an advisor to former Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic minority leader during the fight over Garland\u2019s nomination. \u201cWe are newly radicalized on judges.\u201d\nBut Republican strategist Alex Conant insisted Trump and the GOP would benefit from what promises to be a fearsome battle, waged from Capitol Hill to the farthest-flung battleground states.\n\u201cA day ago this election was a referendum on Trump and his handling of COVID,\u201d Conant said. \u201cNow it\u2019s going to be a referendum on the Supreme Court.\u201d\nDespite recent history, McConnell suggested there was no contradiction in pressing ahead with Ginsburg\u2019s replacement.\n\u201cIn the last midterm election before Justice Scalia\u2019s death in 2016, Americans elected a Republican Senate majority because we pledged to check and balance the last days of a lame-duck president\u2019s second term,\u201d he said. \u201cWe kept our promise.\u201d\n\u201cBy contrast, Americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary. Once again, we will keep our promise,\u201d McConnell said.\nHowever, at least two Republicans could break party ranks, complicating McConnell\u2019s efforts and Trump\u2019s hopes of appointing his third justice to the high court, after Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh.\nSen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told Alaska Public Media on Friday before Ginsburg died that she would not support confirming a justice so close to an election.\n\u201cI would not vote to confirm a Supreme Court nominee. We are 50-some days away from an election,\u201d she said, adding that she was using the same justification McConnell used in 2016.\nMaine Sen. Susan Collins, enmeshed in a stiff reelection battle in good part because of her vote to seat Kavanaugh, told the New York Times last month that she would not seat a justice in October, calling it \u201ctoo close\u201d to November\u2019s election. She issued a statement Friday night mourning Ginsburg\u2019s death but saying nothing about her potential successor.\nThough several Republicans have said this year that they would hypothetically support moving a nomination before an election, it is unclear whether enough of them will actually do so.\nMcConnell can afford to lose no more than three of his 53 Republicans, which would require Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie.\nOne lawmaker expected to play a high-profile role in the political fight is Biden\u2019s running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nThe senior Democrat on the committee, which will hold hearings on a Supreme Court nominee, is California\u2019s other senator, Dianne Feinstein.\nAs Collins\u2019 closely watched actions suggest, Ginsburg\u2019s death will also roil the battle for control of the Senate, putting fresh pressure on Republicans in tough reelection races, including contests in Georgia, North Carolina and Montana.\nRepublican Sen. Joni Ernst, facing a difficult reelection fight in Iowa, sent a fundraising email bluntly stating what is likely to be Republicans\u2019 argument in the presidential and Senate campaigns this fall.\nWith the subject line, \u201cBREAKING: The future of the Supreme Court is on the line,\u201d the email cited guns, abortion and border policy and said, \u201cIf conservatives fail to protect the White House and the Senate majority in November, we will place the power of the next nominee into the Left\u2019s hands.\u201d\nShowing the sensitivity of the matter, Ernst soon retracted the fundraising solicitation and apologized.\n\u201cThis email never should have gone out,\u201d she said in a statement to Radio Iowa. \u201cThough I never saw it, it was sent out under my name and I take responsibility for it. Tonight, my prayers are with the family of Justice Ginsburg.\u201d\nBarabak reported from San Francisco and Hook from Portland, Maine. Times staff writers David Savage, Jennifer Haberkorn, Chris Megerian and Sarah D. Wire in Washington and Seema Mehta in Grand Rapids, Mich., contributed to this report.\n\n\nFor the record:\n8:10 PM, Sep. 18, 2020: A previous version of this story said Harry Reid was Democratic Senate majority leader during the fight over Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination. He was Senate minority leader.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",
            "Drew Angerer\nOn Feb. 13, 2016, then-Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was found dead in a ranch bedroom in Texas. It was 268 days before the November election and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) was quick to quip that there would not be a replacement until the next president was chosen.\nOn Friday evening, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died of complications from cancer 46 days before the presidential election. But McConnell has already made it clear that he sees no reason to wait for voters to weigh in on who should pick her replacement. The Kentucky Republican declared just hours after the death was announced: \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d\nMcConnell\u2019s monomaniacal focus on filling the courts with young conservatives will be tested in the next few months by a variety of factors. But the main one will be whether four Senate Republicans will prove unwilling to go along with confirming a replacement for Ginsburg after their party spent 237 days denying Judge Merrick Garland\u2014President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for the Scalia seat\u2014a hearing, let alone a vote.\nAlready, one of those Republicans, Sen. Lisa Murkowksi (R-AK), has said she would not support filing a Supreme Court vacancy in 2020, citing the Garland precedent, a position she reiterated on Friday night. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) had made a similar declaration. And even close Trump allies\u2014albeit ideologically heterodoxical ones\u2014were making arguments to let the election conclude before filling the post.\n\u201cOf course they should [wait] but they won\u2019t,\u201d Alan Dershowitz, a celebrity attorney who also served on Trump\u2019s legal defense during the impeachment trial, said on Friday night, reacting to the news. \u201cI\u2019m deeply distressed. She was a great woman, a great justice, and a great American\u2026 I think the Republicans are going to try to push it through\u2026 If it\u2019s a close election, they will want to have their justices on the bench.\u201d\nStory continues\nAsked if he had the chance, what he would say to President Trump now, Dershowitz added, \u201cI would say Republicans ought to stick to their position that they took when Scalia died\u2026 Let the American people decide who they want to see nominate the next Supreme Court justice.\u201d\nBut elsewhere, there were not many overt calls for patience from Trump world figures. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who chairs the Judiciary Committee through which any nomination must go, had previously said he would also oppose any confirmation during an election year. But the senator also finds himself in a dogged re-election fight, with a particular need to ramp up support from conservative voters in his state. The statement he released after Ginsburg\u2019s death conveyed no position on\u2014and, therefore, no hesitation with\u2014filling the seat.\n\u201cIt was with great sadness that I learned of the passing of Justice Ginsburg,\u201d Graham said. \u201cJustice Ginsburg was a trailblazer who possessed tremendous passion for her causes. She served with honor and distinction as a member of the Supreme Court. While I had many differences with her on legal philosophy, I appreciate her service to our nation. My thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends. May she Rest In Peace.\u201d\nFor Democrats, there are few if any tools they possess to stop a nomination from going through, save mustering up an overwhelming amount of public pressure to persuade those four Republicans to not only oppose a nominee through the election, but through the period after the election until the next president is inaugurated.\nIt\u2019s a gargantuan task. Among Democrats and liberal activists, there was widespread mourning, but also an immediate, historic sense of urgency and calls to action and strategizing. Around 9:30 p.m. on Friday, various progressive groups, including Demand Justice, convened an emergency conference call to discuss the way forward following Ginsburg\u2019s death, according to a source familiar with the matter. Demand Justice announced on the call that it is pledging a $10 million ad campaign around the vacancy fight.\nPublicly, Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) tweeted that \u201cthis vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president\u201d\u2014adopting, verbatim, the language McConnell had used after Scalia\u2019s death.\nBut to many Democrats, the question was not whether McConnell would push for a nominee, but when.\n\u201cI think the only question is whether he tries to jam it through now or the lame duck. Either would be a clear abuse of the process but that won\u2019t stop McConnell,\u201d said Jim Manley, a former top aide to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV). \u201cUnder no scenario,\u201d Manley added, would McConnell wait until the next president.\nManley said that it was his suspicion that the process would happen after the election due to the sheer logistics of getting a nominee confirmed. There was, he noted, the need for a background investigation, a review by the Judiciary Committee itself, a hearing on the nominee, and procedural hurdles that could drag out two or more weeks. The average number of days to confirm a Supreme Court justice is 70, according to the Congressional Research Service. But there is also nothing that prevents McConnell from scrapping those norms and rules altogether, should he want to expedite matters.\n\u201cRules are rules, but they\u2019ve long become accustomed to them breaking the norms,\u201d said Manley.\nPeople gather to mourn the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the steps in front of the Supreme Court. Tasos Katopodis/Getty\nWithin the GOP conference, there\u2019s less of a clear sense as to what McConnell will do. The Kentucky senator, focused on retaining the GOP majority at all costs this fall, faces a situation where the politics of an election-eve Supreme Court fight could have varying effects for his most vulnerable members. A key swing vote for Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), faces the re-election battle of her career this fall, and could burnish the independent image she touts by opposing any confirmation. Other moderates in tough races could make similar calculations. So too could Sen. Mitt Romney\u2014the president\u2019s sharpest GOP critic in the Senate\u2014as well as several retiring Republicans.\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Outsider\u2019s Champion, Has Died at 87\nHere Are the Ways to Stop Mitch and Trump From Replacing RBG\nTo placate those members, McConnell could hold off until after the election. But he\u2019s not the only actor in this play. Trump has long credited his 2016 win to the conservative voter enthusiasm over the possibility of filling a Supreme Court vacancy. And a potential vacancy at the high court has never been far from the minds of top White House officials. Earlier this month during a formal press conference in the Diplomatic Reception Room, Trump announced he had expanded his list of possible judicial picks by 20 individuals including Sens. Ted Cruz (TX), Tom Cotton (AR), and Josh Hawley (MO), as well as a rising Republican rising star, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron.\n\u201cShould there be another vacancy on the Supreme Court during my presidency, my nominee will come from the names I have shared with the American public, including the original list and these 20 additions,\u201d Trump said during a press conference on Sept. 9.\nTrump then challenged former Vice President Joe Biden to release a list of potential nominees\u2014a dare the Democratic nominee has, so far, ignored.\nBut while Trump recently produced a fresh list of potential nominees, speculation about whom he would pick has centered largely around Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who serves on the Seventh Court of Appeals. In picking Barrett, Trump would please his conservative base but also create a potentially thorny confirmation process at a time when tensions are already at a fever pitch.\nA former clerk for Justice Antonin Scalia, Barrett has the reputation as a conservative, but in many ways is still untested on major issues that could come up before the Supreme Court.\nAt 48, Barrett would be the youngest of the potential justices Trump has considered for the court and she has the least experience of anyone on the Supreme Court bench.\nNews of Ginsburg\u2019s death broke as Trump was at a Minnesota campaign rally, giddily running through a standard roster of applause lines. As he spoke, he did not appear to know about the political and legal grenade that had just been tossed into official Washington. Two Trump aides told The Daily Beast mid-speech that the president didn\u2019t know, though various other senior administration officials were well aware and preparing to discuss the matter with him, as soon as later in the evening.\nAmy Coney Barrett, the Trump Supreme Court Pick Who\u2019ll Troll Liberals the Hardest\nThough apparently not yet informed of Ginsburg\u2019s death, Trump did mention the importance of the court\u2014part of a familiar rally riff that took on new weight in light of the new political reality.\n\u201cAnd that's why the Supreme Court is so important, because the next president will get one, two, three or four Supreme Court justices,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI had two. Many presidents have had none, they've had none, because they're there for a long time.\u201d\nAt the White House in Washington, D.C., the American flag was quickly lowered on Friday to half-staff in memory of Justice Ginsburg, according to White House spokesman Ben Williamson.\nAs Trump boarded Air Force One, he told reporters he had just learned of Ginsburg\u2019s death.\n\u201dJust now?\u201d he responded when asked about her death, according to CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. \u201cShe led an amazing life.

            "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed to rapidly move on any Trump nomination to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. (J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press)\nWouldn\u2019t it be nice if Democrats and Republicans could just agree that the fair and right course would be to not replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg until after the presidential inauguration in January? We could simply stick, for now, with the precedent established by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell when he refused to hold a vote on the nomination of Merrick Garland to replace Justice Antonin Scalia.\nAt the time, nearly nine months before the 2016 presidential election, he declared, \u201cThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\u201d\nBut just hours after the announcement of Ginsburg\u2019s death on Friday, McConnell declared, \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d\nThere is little Democrats can do to stop Trump from nominating someone and the Republicans from confirming that person quickly, if that\u2019s what they choose to do. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, and they have eliminated the use of the filibuster in Supreme Court nominations. So the hope must be that four Republican senators \u2014 perhaps those facing tight reelection races \u2014 will have the courage to stand up to their party and refuse to allow a confirmation to be rushed through.\nThat is probably a distant hope. So far, Senate Republicans have shown little inclination to stand up to Trump and McConnell, as was evident in their confirming Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, despite compelling testimony about an alleged sexual assault and perjury \u2014 and despite clear evidence that he lacked judicial temperament. Nor did Republicans demonstrate any independence or courage during the impeachment of Trump.\nThat leaves Democrats with few cards to play at a crucial moment for our democracy. The stakes are enormous. Last term, with Ginsburg on the bench, the court handed down surprising 5-4 decisions to protect individual rights, including a decision to strike down Louisiana\u2019s restrictive abortion law and to invalidate Trump\u2019s rescission of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. If Ginsburg is replaced by a hard-line conservative who puts politics and feelings ahead of the law, the chance of such rulings will evaporate.\nStory continues\nOn the current court, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. is ideologically in the middle. To be sure, he is to the right of America\u2019s current political center, but at times he joins with the liberals, including in a vote to uphold the Affordable Care Act. If Ginsburg is replaced with someone from the far right, like Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who is frequently mentioned as a likely nominee, there will be five justices substantially more conservative than Roberts. There would be virtually no hope that abortion rights could survive such a court, and little chance of checking Trump.\nOne way for Democrats to make clear they will not tolerate Republicans trying to fill this seat in advance of the election would be for them to pledge that, if they take the White House and Senate in November, they will increase the size of the Supreme Court to 13 justices.\nThe number of justices on the court is set by federal law, not the Constitution. Since its beginnings, it has ranged from having between five and 10 members. Since the 1860s, it has remained at nine.\nWhen President Franklin Roosevelt suggested expanding the Supreme Court in the 1930s to overcome court hostility to the New Deal, he was repudiated for trying to pack the court. But the current situation is different. This would be a response to chicanery by Republicans.\nWhat happened with Garland\u2019s nomination was unprecedented, and Democrats rightly believe it was a stolen seat. After Scalia\u2019s death in February 2016, President Obama moved quickly, nominating Garland the next month.\nPrior to that time, there had been 24 Supreme Court vacancies in presidential election years. In 21 instances, the Senate confirmed the nominee and in three instances it did not. But never before had the Senate refused to hold hearings and vote. If Republicans now rapidly confirm a replacement for Ginsburg, an antidote from the Democrats will be necessary.\nThe threat of increasing the size of the court to 13 might be enough to discourage Republicans from their dirty tricks. But if they do it anyway, and the November election produces a Democratic win in the White House and a Democratic majority in the Senate, Congress would be totally justified in increasing the size of the court.\nIt shouldn\u2019t have to come to this. Republicans should be trying to bridge differences rather than inflaming the situation. It is sad that just hours after Ginsburg\u2019s death the focus is on the political machinations rather than her legacy.\nNo other justice in history has become a popular icon in the way she did. She modeled for all of us in how to spend a life working to make society and individual lives better. We only can hope for a new justice in her mold.\nErwin Chemerinsky is dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law and a contributing writer to Opinion.\n\n\nFor the record:\n8:14 AM, Sep. 19, 2020: In a previous version of this article, Judge Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s last name was misspelled as Barret.\n",
            "Both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Donald Trump want a vote on his nominee to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- but they're not expected to find that easy going.\nThe GOP effort could be thwarted by as few as four Republicans siding with Democrats.\nOne of them, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said Saturday that any confirmation vote should wait until after the presidential election and that the man elected Nov. 3 should select the nominee.\nPHOTO: Susan Collins speaks on the Senate floor, Feb. 4, 2020, in Washington, DC. (Pool/Senate TV)\n\u201dI do not believe that the Senate should vote on the nominee prior to the election,\u201d Collins, who is in a fierce re-election battle, said in a statement Saturday. \u201dIn fairness to the American people, who will either be re-electing the President or selecting a new one, the decision on a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court should be made by the President who is elected on November 3rd.\u201d\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, is expected to join Collins in opposition. Both women support abortion rights, and both have stated that they believe how the GOP-controlled Senate handled President Barack Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, in 2016 sets a precedent that ought to be followed in 2020.\n\u201dWhen Republicans held off Merrick Garland it was because nine months prior to the election was too close, we needed to let people decide. And I agreed to do that,\u201d Murkowski told The Hill this summer. \u201dIf we now say that months prior to the election is OK when nine months was not, that is a double standard and I don\u2019t believe we should do it.\u201d\nPHOTO: Republican Sen.

The source said that could make it harder for some to oppose the nominee.\nPHOTO: Sen. Lindsey Graham listens during a hearing with the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies on Capitol Hill, in Washington, Sept. 16, 2020. (Pool/Reuters)\nTrump said Saturday afternoon he \u201dtotally disagrees\u201d with Collins.\n\u201dWell, I totally disagree with her. We have an obligation. We won. And we have an obligation as the winners to pick who we want. That's not the next president. Hopefully, I will be the next president,\u201d he told reporters as he left the White House for a campaign rally in North Carolina.\nWhen a reporter asked, \u201dWhat about Obama?\u201d Trump responded, \u201dBut we're here now, right now we're here, and we have an obligation to the voters, all of the people, the millions of people that put us here, in the form of a victory. We have an obligation to them, to all of those voters, and it's a very simple thing. So, I would disagree. If that's what she said, that's not the way I read it. I read it differently, but, but if that's what she said, I totally disagree.\u201d\nOnce Trump has named his pick, which he said would come \u201dnext week,\u201d it will be up to Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham to shepherd the nominee through his committee.\nGraham announced Saturday that he will take up a Trump nomination just 45 days to the \u200bpresidential election, reversing his past position on the matter, doing so in an election year when control of the Senate hangs in the balance.\n\u201cI will support President @realDonaldTrump in any effort to move forward regarding the recent vacancy created by the passing of Justice Ginsburg,\u201d Graham, of South Carolina, tweeted Saturday.\nThat about-face also puts Graham in line with McConnell, who announced in a statement Friday evening that Trump\u2019s nominee \u201cwill get a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate\u201d shortly after the news broke of Ginsburg\u2019s death.\nBoth men famously blocked Obama's nomination of Garland, his pick to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia almost 11 months before the 2016 presidential election.\nIn 2016 Graham argued that he believed the vacancy came too close to a presidential election at a time when the Senate and the White House were controlled by different parties.\n\u201cIf there is a Republican President in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say \u2018Lindsey Graham said let us let the next President, whoever it might be, make that nomination and you could use my words against me, and you would be absolutely right,\u201d Graham said at the time.\nMORE: Donald Trump to put forth nominee to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in coming days: Sources\nPHOTO: Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaks during a news conference at the US Capitol, in Washington, June 17, 2020.

Later, the Kentucky senator went on to say that he opposed pushing a nomination through because the Senate was controlled by Republicans at the time, while the White House was held by a Democrat.\nIn a speech in his home state, McConnell said that telling Obama that his nomination would not clear the Senate was \u201cone of the proudest moments\u201d of his Senate career.\nSenate Democrats and their outside allied groups have blasted the shift by McConnell and are expected to fight to keep a third Trump nominee from the highest court in the land.\nPHOTO:Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer speaks at a news conference with reporters at the Capitol, in Washington, July 23, 2020. (Erin Scott/Reuters)\nMinority Leader Chuck Schumer told Senate Democrats in a conference call Saturday afternoon that their \u201dnumber one goal\u201d must be to communicate what is at stake in the upcoming battle to fill the seat, according to a source familiar with the call.\nStill, because of a rules change engineered by Republicans in 2017, Democrats have no real procedural tools at their disposal to stop the GOP majority from pushing through a nomination.\nIn 2017, Republicans altered the rules of the Senate to allow a simple majority of the chamber to approve a Supreme Court nomination -- at the time, conservative jurist Neil Gorsuch -- down from the 60-vote threshold previously needed for high court appointees and legislative measures to move forward to a final vote.\nConservatives are pushing for the eventual nominee to be confirmed by Election Day, something several GOP leadership aides and former officials responsible for the Senate nomination process said would be nearly impossible.\nOn average, a nomination takes 70 days from nomination to final Senate confirmation, according to a 2018 Congressional Research Service Report. That said, John Paul Stevens waited just 19 days, followed by Sandra Day O\u2019Connor whose nomination lasted just over a month, the report noted.\nABC News' Elizabeth Thomas contributed to this report.\nAs Senate Republicans push for vote on Supreme Court nominee, Collins objects originally appeared on abcnews.go.com",

Garland was nominated by President Obama, a Democrat. However, McConnell has said he would not do the same if a seat suddenly became vacant ahead of this year's election, as President Trump would nominate a conservative justice.\nIn his statement on Friday, McConnell argued that it was not hypocritical to vote on a vacancy so close to the election after refusing to do so four years earlier, as the Republican Party now controls both the Senate and the White House.\n\u201dIn the last midterm election before Justice Scalia's death in 2016, Americans elected a Republican Senate majority because we pledged to check and balance the last days of a lame-duck president's second term. We kept our promise,\u201d McConnell said. \u201dBy contrast, Americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary. Once again, we will keep our promise.\u201d\nMcConnell's statement echoes what he has previously said about voting to confirm a Trump nominee for the Supreme Court in an election year. Asked at an event in 2019 if he would fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court during an election year, McConnell said, \u201doh, we'd fill it,\u201d prompting laughter from the audience. McConnell repeated this sentiment in an interview with Fox News in February.\n\u201dIf you're asking me a hypothetical about whether this Republican Senate would confirm a member of the Supreme Court due to a vacancy created this year \u2014 yeah, we would fill it,\u201d McConnell said.\nSenator Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in May that filling a vacant Supreme Court seat before the election \u201dwould be the goal.\u201d\n\u201dIf a vacancy did occur...that you would see an effort by Republicans, I'm sure, to fill the vacancy,\u201d Graham said. This contradicts a comment Graham made in 2018, when he said \u201dif an opening comes in the last year of President Trump's term, and the primary process has started, we'll wait to the next election.\u201d\nThe vacant seat has already become a campaign issue, moments after Ginsburg's death was announced. Iowa Starting Line reported that Senator Joni Ernst's campaign sent out an email to supporters fundraising off of the court. Ernst is considered one of the more vulnerable Republicans up for reelection this year.\nSenator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, who is also up for reelection this year, tweeted on Friday evening that Mr. Trump \u201dhas every right to pick a new justice before the election.\u201d\n\u201dI look forward to supporting a strict constructionist who will protect the right to life & safeguard our conservative values,\u201d Loeffler wrote.\nSenator Martha McSally of Arizona, also up for reelection his year, tweeted, \u201dThis U.S. Senate should vote on President Trump's next nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201d\nHowever, some Republican senators have indicated they may be uncomfortable with moving forward on confirming a justice so close to the election. Senator Lisa Murkowski said in August of this year that voting to confirm a Supreme Court justice now would present a \u201ddouble standard.\u201d\n\u201dWhen Republicans held off Merrick Garland it was because nine months prior to the election was too close, we needed to let people decide. And I agreed to do that. If we now say that months prior to the election is OK when nine months was not, that is a double standard and I don't believe we should do it,\u201d Murkowski said.\nThe New York Times reported Senator Susan Collins has also said she would oppose confirming a new justice so close to the election. Collins, who voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, is locked in a tight race for reelection in Maine.\nSenator Chuck Grassley in August equivocated on whether he would vote to fill a vacant seat, saying, \u201din the abstract, I would do the same thing in 2020 that I would in 2016.\u201d\nIn a letter sent to his Republican colleagues obtained by CBS News, McConnell urged GOP senators to \u201dbe cautious and keep your powder dry until we return to Washington.\u201d\n\u201dThis is not the time to prematurely lock yourself into a position you may later regret,\u201d McConnell said.\nMr. Trump is expected to nominate a replacement for Ginsburg, whose death leaves an open seat on a court where conservative justices already outnumber liberals. The president earlier this month announced his list of possible Supreme Court nominees, should he have the occasion to nominate more justices either in his current term or the next one.

Whatever the outcome of the presidential election, Collins could lose her campaign for reelection and she may choose to vote for the president's nominee before leaving office.\nMeanwhile, Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham said on Saturday that he supports filling the seat. McConnell has also said that Mr. Trump's nominee will receive a vote on the Senate floor.",
            "As Senate Republicans push for vote on Supreme Court nominee, Collins objects Susan Collins said there should be no confirmation vote before the election.\nBoth Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Donald Trump want a vote on his nominee to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- but they're not expected to find that easy going.\nThe GOP effort could be thwarted by as few as four Republicans siding with Democrats.\nOne of them, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said Saturday that any confirmation vote should wait until after the presidential election and that the man elected Nov. 3 should select the nominee.\n\u201dI do not believe that the Senate should vote on the nominee prior to the election,\u201d Collins, who is in a fierce re-election battle, said in a statement Saturday. \u201dIn fairness to the American people, who will either be re-electing the President or selecting a new one, the decision on a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court should be made by the President who is elected on November 3rd.\u201d\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, is expected to join Collins in opposition. Both women support abortion rights, and both have stated that they believe how the GOP-controlled Senate handled President Barack Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, in 2016 sets a precedent that ought to be followed in 2020.\n\u201dWhen Republicans held off Merrick Garland it was because nine months prior to the election was too close, we needed to let people decide. And I agreed to do that,\u201d Murkowski told The Hill this summer. \u201dIf we now say that months prior to the election is OK when nine months was not, that is a double standard and I don\u2019t believe we should do it.\u201d\nOther Republicans who will be watched closely in the coming weeks have not yet made their positions known, seemingly, unlike Collins, following the advice of McConnell who Friday advised his members to \u201ckeep the powder dry\u201d in a letter obtained by the Washington Post and confirmed by ABC News.\nEyes will be on Sen. Mitt Romney, who was the lone Republican to vote in favor of Trump\u2019s impeachment at the beginning of the year.\nSenate institutionalists, like Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, as well as those up for reelection and especially vulnerable, like Cory Gardner, R-Colo., could also voice opposition.\nA GOP source with knowledge of the matter tells ABC News that conservatives are pushing President Trump to name a replacement soon in order to \u201dput a face and a personal story\u201d behind their push to replace Justice Ginsburg. The source said that could make it harder for some to oppose the nominee.\nTrump said Saturday afternoon he \u201dtotally disagrees\u201d with Collins.\n\u201dWell, I totally disagree with her. We have an obligation. We won. And we have an obligation as the winners to pick who we want. That's not the next president. Hopefully, I will be the next president,\u201d he told reporters as he left the White House for a campaign rally in North Carolina.\nWhen a reporter asked, \u201dWhat about Obama?\u201d Trump responded, \u201dBut we're here now, right now we're here, and we have an obligation to the voters, all of the people, the millions of people that put us here, in the form of a victory. We have an obligation to them, to all of those voters, and it's a very simple thing. So, I would disagree. If that's what she said, that's not the way I read it. I read it differently, but, but if that's what she said, I totally disagree.\u201d\nOnce Trump has named his pick, which he said would come \u201dnext week,\u201d it will be up to Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham to shepherd the nominee through his committee.\nGraham announced Saturday that he will take up a Trump nomination just 45 days to the \u200bpresidential election, reversing his past position on the matter, doing so in an election year when control of the Senate hangs in the balance.\n\u201cI will support President @realDonaldTrump in any effort to move forward regarding the recent vacancy created by the passing of Justice Ginsburg,\u201d Graham, of South Carolina, tweeted Saturday.\nThat about-face also puts Graham in line with McConnell, who announced in a statement Friday evening that Trump\u2019s nominee \u201cwill get a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate\u201d shortly after the news broke of Ginsburg\u2019s death.\nBoth men famously blocked Obama's nomination of Garland, his pick to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia almost 11 months before the 2016 presidential election.\nIn 2016 Graham argued that he believed the vacancy came too close to a presidential election at a time when the Senate and the White House were controlled by different parties.\n\u201cIf there is a Republican President in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say \u2018Lindsey Graham said let us let the next President, whoever it might be, make that nomination and you could use my words against me, and you would be absolutely right,\u201d Graham said at the time.\nMcConnell also said in 2016 that Garland\u2019s nomination came too close to a presidential election. Later, the Kentucky senator went on to say that he opposed pushing a nomination through because the Senate was controlled by Republicans at the time, while the White House was held by a Democrat.\nIn a speech in his home state, McConnell said that telling Obama that his nomination would not clear the Senate was \u201cone of the proudest moments\u201d of his Senate career.\nSenate Democrats and their outside allied groups have blasted the shift by McConnell and are expected to fight to keep a third Trump nominee from the highest court in the land.\nMinority Leader Chuck Schumer told Senate Democrats in a conference call Saturday afternoon that their \u201dnumber one goal\u201d must be to communicate what is at stake in the upcoming battle to fill the seat, according to a source familiar with the call.\nStill, because of a rules change engineered by Republicans in 2017, Democrats have no real procedural tools at their disposal to stop the GOP majority from pushing through a nomination.\nIn 2017, Republicans altered the rules of the Senate to allow a simple majority of the chamber to approve a Supreme Court nomination -- at the time, conservative jurist Neil Gorsuch -- down from the 60-vote threshold previously needed for high court appointees and legislative measures to move forward to a final vote.\nConservatives are pushing for the eventual nominee to be confirmed by Election Day, something several GOP leadership aides and former officials responsible for the Senate nomination process said would be nearly impossible.\nOn average, a nomination takes 70 days from nomination to final Senate confirmation, according to a 2018 Congressional Research Service Report. That said, John Paul Stevens waited just 19 days, followed by Sandra Day O\u2019Connor whose nomination lasted just over a month, the report noted.\nABC News' Elizabeth Thomas contributed to this report.",
            "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Friday that he will hold a vote on President Donald Trump's nominee to fill the vacancy left by the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court.\nIn a statement issued just over an hour after the Supreme Court said that Ginsburg had passed, McConnell said the nominee, who has not been named, \u201dwill receive a vote on the floor.\u201d\nMcConnell's pledge puts in motion what is likely to be a historic battle over the court in the heat of an already intense election year. The Supreme Court had a 5-4 majority of Republican appointed justices. A 6-3 majority could have a dramatic impact on the shape of the law on business and social issues for a generation to come.\nTrump, battling against former Vice President Joe Biden ahead of November's presidential election, is expected to move quickly to name a conservative replacement. The president didn't comment much Friday night beyond telling reporters that Ginsburg \u201dled an amazing life. She was an amazing woman.\u201d\nBiden, for his part, said that the focus in the coming days should be on Ginsburg's legacy, but added that \u201dthe voters should pick a president.\u201d\n\u201dThis was the position of Republican Senate took in 2016. When they were almost 10 months to go before the election. That's the position the United States Senate must take today, and election is only 46 days off,\u201d Biden said.\nRead more: \u2018Thank you, RBG\u2019: Leaders react with sadness, shock to Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death\nMcConnell's statement marks a contrast to his position last election cycle, in which he refused to hold hearings for former President Barack Obama's nominee, but is consistent with statements he has made since Trump was elected.\nIt came despite reports that Ginsburg told her family before she died that it was her \u201dfervent wish\u201d that she not be replaced until a new election is held.\nThe timing of Ginsburg's death ensured that mourning in Washington would be combined with political calculations. The justice, who sat on the bench for 27 years and was the second woman confirmed to the top court, passed after suffering from pancreatic cancer just 46 days before Election Day.\nEven before Ginsburg's passing, Trump was seeking to win over conservatives with the promise of new justices who would be sympathetic on issues like gun rights and abortion. Earlier in September, Trump added 20 new names to his Supreme Court shortlist, including three GOP senators.\nIf Trump nominates a replacement for Ginsburg by Tuesday, and that nominee is confirmed before Election Day, it will mark the quickest period between nomination and confirmation since Ginsburg herself was appointed by former President Bill Clinton in 1993. On average, it takes about 70 days from the date of nomination to the confirmation vote, according to the Congressional Research Service.",

As soon as the plane landed I turned on my device and found out Justice Scalia had passed away.\nI went to my room, turned on the television, started thinking first about my relationship with him over the years. And second, fast forward as you always do in the political business to the present, and I sent out a statement saying this vacancy will be filled by the person that's going to be elected President of the United States this November. Boom.\nWhy did I do it so quickly? I had members all over the country and all over the world. I didn't want to deal with 52 different opinions when we got back about how we were going to handle it. And so I decided to lay down a marker and hope that people would fall in line. And with few exceptions, they did. We also decided not to have any hearings or any processing of the nomination because it was my anticipated that President Obama would name a well-qualified person and he did.\nMcConnell added that he did not want the debate \u201dto be about the person, I wanted it to be about the process.\u201d\nThe majority leader said Friday night why he believes there is a difference between 2016 and 2020: \u201dIn the last midterm election before Justice Scalia\u2019s death in 2016, Americans elected a Republican Senate majority because we pledged to check and balance the last days of a lame-duck president\u2019s second term.

That is the position the United States Senate must take now, when the election is less than two months away. We are talking about the Constitution and the Supreme Court.

Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Merrick Garland.\nBut Hans Von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told Fox News that it is not unprecedented for an incumbent president seeking re-election to nominate a judge to the Supreme Court, and be confirmed, prior to Election Day.\n\u201dHistorically, since 1900, presidents have made five Supreme Court nominations in the year they were running for re-election: Taft in 1912; Wilson in 1916, in fact he had two nominations; Hoover in 1932; and the great hero of the Democratic Party, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, did it in 1940,\u201d Spakovsky told Fox News. \u201dAll of those nominations were confirmed.\u201d\nHe added: \u201dIt is not as if this would somehow be unprecedented. ...The point is, prior presidents have done it, their nominees have been confirmed, and there is no reason it can't be done this year, too.\u201d",

Her wish will figure in the debate that\u2019s likely to ensue if President Donald Trump goes forward with appointing a new Supreme Court justice before the election on Nov. 3.\nMcConnell has previously said that he would move forward with approving a justice should an opening come up ahead of Election Day.\nTrump, apparently unaware of the news of Ginsburg\u2019s death, twice brought up the importance of appointing a Supreme Court justice as he spoke at a rally in Minnesota. Some people shouted that Ginsburg has passed by the president didn\u2019t appear to have caught what was said.\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to supporters during a rally at the Bemidji Regional Airport in Bemidji, Minnesota, on Sept. 18, 2020. (Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)\n\u201cWe will nominate judges and justices who will interpret the constitution as written,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the Supreme Court is so important. The next president will get one, two, three, or four Supreme Court justices.\u201d\n\u201cThink of that, that will totally change when you talk about life, when you talk about Second Amendment, when you talk about things that are so important to you.\u201d\nTrump recently announced a list of potential Supreme Court picks, including Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)\n\u201cApart from matters of war and peace, the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice is the most important decision an American president can make,\u201d Trump said at the White House in Washington.\nThe president has already appointed two Supreme Court Justices, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation turned into a political spectacle after Senate Democrats late in the process unveiled a complaint from a woman who accused Kavanaugh of misconduct. The woman\u2019s allegations proved unsubstantiated and Kavanaugh was confirmed, but not before a dramatic Senate hearing which captured the attention of the nation.\nTrump has warned of a dismal future if the Supreme Court ever included a majority of Democrat-appointed justices, claiming they would \u201cerase the Second Amendment, silence political speech, require taxpayers to fund extreme late-term abortion.\u201d\n\u201cIn the recent past, many of our most treasured freedoms including religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms, have been saved by a single vote on the United States Supreme Court,\u201d he said.\nA private service for Ginsburg will be held at Arlington National Ceremony in Virginia, the Supreme Court said in a statement.\nPeople gather to mourn the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the steps in front of the Supreme Court in Washington, on Sept. 18, 2020.

Her stance on the issue is mostly in alignment with the Democrats.\nRepublicans and Democrats fell into a fierce battle over Ginsburg\u2019s vacancy following her death.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced right after the death of Ginsburg that Trump\u2019s nominee will get a Senate vote. A day later, President Donald Trump urged Republicans to confirm Ginsberg\u2019s replacement \u201cwithout delay.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Democrats, including presidential candidate Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), insisted the process should be postponed to some time after the November election and the nomination should be left to the one who wins the presidency.\nDemocrats tried to convince Republicans to follow the principle set during the nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016.\nGarland was nominated by former President Barack Obama to replace Justice Antonin Scalia after he died. The nomination was blocked by McConnell, who said that the Republicans wouldn\u2019t consider Obama\u2019s nominee because they felt the vacancy should be filled by whoever won the 2016 election.\nHowever, McConnell said Friday the situation was different then because the Senate and the presidency were held by different parties. Republicans currently control both.\n\u201cIn the last midterm election before Justice Scalia\u2019s death in 2016, Americans elected a Republican Senate majority because we pledged to check and balance the last days of a lame-duck president\u2019s second term.

And I think we risk a constitutional crisis if we do not have a nine-justice Supreme Court, particularly when there is such a risk of a contested election.\u201d\nThe Republicans currently hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate.\nThe views of some other key Republican players in this battle are still unclear.\nSeveral top Republicans and some other potential swing votes in the Senate, including Sens.

We have this obligation, without delay!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter.\nWhether the Senate GOP conference will be able to hold its ranks, though, is another question.\nJustice Ginsburg made a death bed declaration that she wanted the seat filled by whoever wins the presidential election.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said just hours after Justice Ginsburg\u2018s death that he would push ahead with whomever Mr. Trump names.\nIn a letter to colleagues, he urged them \u201cto keep your powder dry\u201d and not lock themselves into a position opposing any vote this year.\nHe said there\u2019s enough time left in the year \u2014 Justice Ginsburg\u2018s own confirmation took 50 days, he said \u2014 and he dismissed complaints that Republicans are being hypocritical by pushing ahead now, after denying President Obama a chance to pick a replacement after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016.\nMr. McConnell says in that instance the White House was controlled by a Democrat and the Senate controlled by the GOP. Now, both are held by the same party.\nDemocrats said that was parsing too much, and insisted Mr. McConnell and his fellow Republicans follow the precedent they set four years ago.\nLiberal pressure groups are already taking that argument to the states, where a half dozen or more Republican senators face tough re-election campaigns.\nSome have already committed to a vote on Mr. Trump\u2019s pick, including Sen.

        "summarized_context": "The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has sparked a political battle over her replacement. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed to hold a vote on President Trump's nominee, while Democrats argue that the seat should not be filled until after the election. McConnell's decision to move forward with a nomination has led to calls from Democrats to eliminate the filibuster and possibly expand the Supreme Court if they gain control of the White House and Senate. McConnell's move also puts vulnerable Republican senators in a difficult position, as they face tough reelection battles and must decide whether to support a nomination before the election. The battle over Ginsburg's seat is expected to be a major campaign issue and could have significant consequences for the court and its decisions on issues such as abortion rights and healthcare."

            "\u00a9 John Minchillo/AP E. Jean Carroll arrives at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse, Oct. 21, 2020, in New York.\nA federal judge on Tuesday rejected the Justice Department\u2019s attempt to represent the president in E Jean Carroll\u2019s defamation lawsuit against President Trump.\nCarroll, a former Elle columnist, claimed in a book Donald Trump raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s, allegations he has denied. She sued him for defamation last year after he called her a liar and said she made up the accusation to sell books.\n\u201cWhile the president possesses all of the executive power of the United States, he is not an 'employee' within the meaning of the FTCA,\u201d Judge Lewis Kaplan said, referring to the Federal Tort Claims Act, which shields federal employees from individual damages claims. \u201cThe FTCA\u2019s definition of that term does not include presidents.\u201d\nCarroll has described the Justice Department\u2019s attempted intervention in her case as part of a pattern of the Justice Department acting as President Trump\u2019s personal law firm.\n\u201cThere is not a single person in the United States \u2014 not the president and not anyone else \u2014 whose job description includes slandering women they sexually assaulted,\u201d Carroll\u2019s attorney, Roberta Kaplan, wrote earlier this month in a legal brief.\nJudge Kaplan, no relation, appeared to agree.\n\u201cThe government thus asserts that this case is virtually identical in principle to a lawsuit against a Postal Service driver for causing a car accident while delivering the mail,\u201d he said in the decision. \u201dBut the word 'virtually' in the last sentence is necessary because there is an important difference between this case and the case of the hypothetical mail driver.\u201d\nRoberta Kaplan, Carroll's lawyer, said in a statement Tuesday: \u201cThe simple truth is that President Trump defamed our client because she was brave enough to reveal that he had sexually assaulted her, and that brutal, personal attack cannot be attributed to the Office of the President. Judge Kaplan\u2019s words speak for themselves.\u201d\nAdded Carroll: \u201cWhen I spoke out about what Donald Trump did to me in a department store dressing room, I was speaking out against an individual. When Donald Trump called me a liar and denied that he had ever met me, he was not speaking on behalf of the United States. I am happy that Judge Kaplan recognized these basic truths.

She sued him for defamation last year after he called her a liar and said she made up the accusation to sell books.\n\u201cWhile the president possesses all of the executive power of the United States, he is not an 'employee' within the meaning of the FTCA,\u201d Judge Lewis Kaplan said, referring to the Federal Tort Claims Act, which shields federal employees from individual damages claims. \u201cThe FTCA\u2019s definition of that term does not include presidents.\u201d\nCarroll has described the Justice Department\u2019s attempted intervention in her case as part of a pattern of the Justice Department acting as President Trump\u2019s personal law firm.\n\u201cThere is not a single person in the United States \u2014 not the president and not anyone else \u2014 whose job description includes slandering women they sexually assaulted,\u201d Carroll\u2019s attorney, Roberta Kaplan, wrote earlier this month in a legal brief.\nJudge Kaplan, no relation, appeared to agree.\n\u201cThe government thus asserts that this case is virtually identical in principle to a lawsuit against a Postal Service driver for causing a car accident while delivering the mail,\u201d he said in the decision. \u201dBut the word 'virtually' in the last sentence is necessary because there is an important difference between this case and the case of the hypothetical mail driver.\u201d\nRoberta Kaplan, Carroll's lawyer, said in a statement Tuesday: \u201cThe simple truth is that President Trump defamed our client because she was brave enough to reveal that he had sexually assaulted her, and that brutal, personal attack cannot be attributed to the Office of the President. Judge Kaplan\u2019s words speak for themselves.\u201d\nAdded Carroll: \u201cWhen I spoke out about what Donald Trump did to me in a department store dressing room, I was speaking out against an individual. When Donald Trump called me a liar and denied that he had ever met me, he was not speaking on behalf of the United States. I am happy that Judge Kaplan recognized these basic truths.

            "A federal judge ruled Tuesday morning that the Justice Department is not allowed to replace President Trump\u2019s personal lawyers and defend him in a defamation lawsuit filed by E. Jean Carroll, an author who accused him of rape, which he has vehemently denied.\nThe judge, Lewis Kaplan of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, rejected the DOJ's argument that the Justice Department should be allowed to take over the defense of the president.\nThe Trump administration claimed that the Federal Tort Claims Act, which allows the U.S. government to protect federal employees from individual damages claims, should apply in this case.\n\u201cThe government moves to substitute the United States for President Trump as the defendant. It does so in essence on the theory that this is not truly a lawsuit against President Trump as a private individual.\u201d Kaplan said in a 61-page opinion. \u201dInstead, the government argues, this is really a lawsuit against the United States because Ms. Carroll has sued an \u2018employee\u2019 of the United States of America for actions within the scope of his employment.\u201d\nKaplan added, \u201dThe President of the United States is not an \u2018employee of the Government\u2019 within the meaning of the relevant statutes. Even if he were such an \u2018employee,\u2019 President Trump's allegedly defamatory statements concerning Ms. Carroll would not have been within the scope of his employment. Accordingly, the motion to substitute the United States in place of President Trump is denied.\u201d\nThe judge then specifically shot down the Justice Department\u2019s claims that the Federal Tort Claims Act, which allows the U.S. government to protect federal employees from individual damages claims, should apply in this case.\n\u201cWhile the president possesses all of the executive power of the United States, he is not an 'employee' within the meaning of the FTCA,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cThe FTCA\u2019s definition of that term does not include presidents.\u201d\nCarroll, 76, filed a lawsuit against the president for defamation in November 2019 after he claimed he knew nothing about her and it never happened. Carroll alleged that Trump raped her in a dressing room at a famous New York City department store more than two decades ago. Carroll wrote a June 2019 article for the Cut where she claimed that \u201cDonald Trump assaulted me in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room 23 years ago. But he\u2019s not alone on the list of awful men in my life.\u201d\nTrump denied Carroll\u2019s claims that same month, including during an Oval Office interview. \u201cI\u2019ll say it with great respect: Number one, she\u2019s not my type. Number two, it never happened. It never happened, OK?\u201d the president said while seated behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. Trump also said Carroll was \u201ctotally lying. I don\u2019t know anything about her. I know nothing about this woman. I know nothing about her. She is \u2014 it\u2019s just a terrible thing that people can make statements like that.\u201d\nCarroll is looking to depose Trump and has requested that he provide a DNA sample to compare to genetic material she said is on a dress that she wore during the alleged sexual assault.\nThe Justice Department told the court in early September that \u201cthe President explained that these accusations were false and that the incident she alleged never happened\u201d and \u201cthe Attorney General\u2019s delegate has certified that President Trump was acting within the scope of his office as President of the United States when he publicly denied as false the allegations made by Plaintiff.\u201d The DOJ said \u201con the basis of this certification, the United States removed the action to this Court pursuant to the Westfall Act\u201d and \u201cpursuant to the same statute, the United States hereby moves the Court to substitute the United States as the party defendant in place of the President.\u201d\nCarroll\u2019s lawyer countered in October that \u201cthere is not a single person in the United States \u2014 not the President and not anyone else \u2014 whose job description includes slandering women they sexually assaulted\u201d and \u201cthey assert that Defendant Donald J. Trump was acting within the scope of his employment as President when he defamed Plaintiff E. Jean Carroll, a woman he sexually assaulted over twenty years ago, as retaliation for revealing his misconduct.\u201d\nAttorney General William Barr defended the Justice Department\u2019s move in September.\n\u201cThis has to do with something called the Westfall Act. That is an act that provides that when tort cases, state tort cases, are brought against government employees in the executive branch and in the legislative branch, and the tort was allegedly committed in the course of federal employment, the case can be certified for shifting to the federal courts and the United States can be substituted as the responsible party,\u201d Barr said during a September press conference, adding, \u201cThis was a normal application of the law, the law is clear, it is done frequently, and the little tempest that\u2019s going on is largely because of the bizarre political environment in which we live.\u201d\n\u201cThe undisputed facts demonstrate that President Trump was not acting in furtherance of any duties owed to any arguable employer when he made the statements at issue,\u201d Kaplan ruled Tuesday. \u201cHis comments concerned an alleged sexual assault that took place several decades before he took office, and the allegations have no relationship to the official business of the United States. To conclude otherwise would require the Court to adopt a view that virtually everything the president does is within the public interest by virtue of his office.

Kaplan came after the Justice Department argued that the United States - and by extension the American people - should replace Trump as the defendant in a lawsuit filed by the columnist E. Jean Carroll.\nThe government\u2019s lawyers contended that the United States could step in as the defendant because Trump was forced to respond to her lawsuit to prove he was physically and mentally fit for the job.\nA lawyer for Carroll, Roberta Kaplan, called it a clear victory for her client.\n\u201cThe simple truth is that President Trump defamed our client because she was brave enough to reveal that he had sexually assaulted her, and that brutal, personal attack cannot be attributed to the Office of the President,\u201d Kaplan said in a statement.\nMessages were left on Tuesday for lawyers for Trump and the Justice Department seeking comment.\nThe judge ruled that a law protecting federal employees from being sued individually for things they do within the scope of their employment didn\u2019t apply to a president.\n\u201cThe President of the United States is not an employee of the Government within the meaning of the relevant statutes,\u201d Kaplan wrote. \u201cEven if he were such an employee, President Trumps allegedly defamatory statements concerning Ms. Carroll would not have been within the scope of his employment.\u201d\nLawyers for Carroll had written that \u201conly in a world gone mad could it somehow be presidential, not personal, for Trump to slander a woman who he sexually assaulted.\u201d\nThe Justice Department relied solely on written arguments in the dispute after its lawyer was banned from a Manhattan federal courthouse last week because he had not quarantined for two weeks after traveling to New York from a state on a list of those whose coronavirus test rates were high.\nCarroll, a former longtime advice columnist for Elle magazine, said in her lawsuit that in the fall of 1995 or spring of 1996 she and Trump met in a chance encounter when they recognized each other at the Bergdorf Goodman store.\nShe said they engaged in a lighthearted chat about trying on a see-through lilac gray bodysuit when they made their way to a dressing room, where she said Trump pushed her against a wall and raped her.\nThe Associated Press does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Carroll has done.\nTrump said Carroll was \u201ctotally lying\u201d to sell a memoir and that he\u2019d never met her, though a 1987 photo showed them and their then-spouses at a social event. He said the photo captured a moment when he was standing in a line.\nIn a statement responding to the ruling on Tuesday, Carroll said: \u201cWhen I spoke out about what Donald Trump did to me in a department store dressing room, I was speaking out against an individual. When Donald Trump called me a liar and denied that he had ever met me, he was not speaking on behalf of the United States.\u201d\nCarroll, who wants unspecified damages and a retraction of Trump\u2019s statements, also seeks a DNA sample from Trump to see whether it matches as-yet-unidentified male genetic material found on a dress that she says she was wearing during the alleged attack.\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.",

Jean Carroll, a former magazine columnist, sued Trump in his personal capacity for defamation last year after he publicly denied her allegation of rape. Kaplan's ruling means Trump cannot use the DOJ to defend him in the case.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\u201dPresident Trump\u2019s comments concerned media reports about an alleged sexual assault that took place more than twenty years before he took office,\u201d Kaplan, who was appointed by former President Clinton, wrote in his 61-page decision. \u201dNeither the media reports nor the underlying allegations have any relationship to his official duties.\u201d\nCarroll published her allegation in June 2019 in New York magazine, writing that Trump, then a private businessman, sexually assaulted her in a department store dressing room.\nTrump denied the allegations, saying \u201dshe's not my type.\u201d\nA White House spokesman was not immediately able to comment.

It later argued that Trump is covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act, a law that allows certain suits to be brought against government employees acting in their official capacity.\nBut the law does not allow for defamation cases against government officials, meaning that if the judge had sided with the DOJ over the issue, Carroll's suit would likely have been thrown out.\nThe DOJ argued that Trump was acting in official capacity when he addressed Carroll's allegations, partly because refuting her claims would help him better carry out his duties. But the judge on Tuesday ruled that theory would be far too expansive if it were adopted by the courts.\n\u201dWhile the government\u2019s position is not entirely without merit, it goes much too far,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201dAccepting it would mean that a president is free [to] defame anyone who criticizes his conduct or impugns his character\u2014without adverse consequences to that president and no matter what injury he inflicts on the person defamed.\u201d\nUpdated at 11:28 a.m."

        "context": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday rejected a U.S. government request to drop Donald Trump as a defendant in a defamation lawsuit by a writer who said the president falsely denied raping her in a Manhattan department store a quarter century ago. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan refused to let the government substitute itself for Trump as a defendant in former Elle magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll\u2019s lawsuit. A ruling for the government would have shielded Trump from liability and likely doomed Carroll\u2019s defamation claim. Carroll had sued Trump last November in a New York state court, after he had denied having raped her in Bergdorf Goodman in the mid-1990s or knowing who she was. Trump said she fabricated the story to sell a new book, and added: \u201cShe\u2019s not my type.\u201d Acting at the behest of Attorney General William Barr, the Department of Justice moved the case to federal court, where it said Trump acted in his official capacity when denying Carroll\u2019s claims, and thus could not be sued personally for defamation. But Kaplan said a law shielding federal employees from being sued for acts done during their employment did not cover presidents. He also said Trump did not make his statements about Carroll in the scope of his employment as president. \u201cNo one even arguably directed or controlled President Trump when he commented on the plaintiff\u2019s accusation, which had nothing to do with the official business of government, that he raped her decades before he took office,\u201d Kaplan wrote in a 61-page decision. \u201cAnd no one had the ability to control him.\u201d The Justice Department declined to comment. Carroll\u2019s lawsuit is one of many legal actions Trump faces as he seeks reelection on Nov. 3. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign event, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, U.S., October 26, 2020. REUTERS/Leah Millis He has denied the claims of several women who accused him of sexual misconduct occurring before he took office. Roberta Kaplan, a lawyer for Carroll, said they looked forward to pursuing the defamation case in federal court. \u201cThe simple truth is that President Trump defamed our client because she was brave enough to reveal that he had sexually assaulted her, and that brutal, personal attack cannot be attributed to the Office of the President,\u201d she said. Carroll said in a statement: \u201cWhen Donald Trump called me a liar and denied that he had ever met me, he was not speaking on behalf of the United States. I am happy that Judge Kaplan recognized these basic truths.\u201d NO FREEDOM TO DEFAME The Justice Department moved the lawsuit to federal court after Justice Verna Saunders of a Manhattan state court had in August rejected Trump\u2019s bid to postpone the case. She said the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent rejection of Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity from criminal proceedings while in office applied to state court proceedings involving his unofficial or personal conduct. That ruling could have allowed Carroll\u2019s lawyers to seek a DNA sample from Trump, to match against a dress Carroll said she wore at Bergdorf Goodman. The Justice Department\u2019s intervention put that process on hold. But the judge said its arguments went \u201cmuch too far\u201d by leaving Trump \u201cfree (to) defame anyone who criticizes his conduct or impugns his character,\u201d without consequences for the president and regardless of the harm to his target. Kaplan said it would be different if Trump were being challenged in court over his official conduct. \u201cA comment about government action, public policy, or even an election is categorically different than a comment about an alleged sexual assault that took place roughly twenty years before the president took office,\u201d he wrote.",

Democrats protested what they called the rushed nature of the proceedings and complained that Barrett had sidestepped questions about presidential powers, abortion, climate change, voting rights and Obamacare.\nRepublicans are aiming for a final confirmation vote on the Senate floor by the end of October following next week\u2019s committee vote.\n\u201cI believe that this rushed, sham process is a disservice to our committee,\u201d Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said. \u201cShe has been rushed in a way that is historically unprecedented ... and the purpose of doing it is simply to have a justice on the Supreme Court, as the president said, to decide the election and to strike down the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\nThe Republican president has asked the Senate to confirm Barrett before the Nov. 3 U.S. election in which he is seeking a second term in office. Trump has said he expects the court to decide the election\u2019s outcome.\nWith Republicans holding a 53-47 Senate majority, her confirmation seems assured. Barrett\u2019s confirmation would give the Supreme Court a 6-3 conservative majority. Barrett, 48, could serve for decades, alongside Trump\u2019s two other Supreme Court selections, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.\n\u201cThere is no way you will ever convince me that Amy Coney Barrett is not qualified, using any reasonable standards of qualification,\u201d said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, the committee chairman.\nBarrett answered questions from senators during marathon sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday. Outside witnesses testified in favor and against Barrett\u2019s nomination on Thursday. Barrett was not present.\nDespite some tense moments, the hearing was conducted largely with a congenial tone. It stood in contrast to the Kavanaugh\u2019s contentious 2018 confirmation hearings in which he angrily denied sexual assault allegations.\nAt the end, Graham told the Democratic senators, \u201cYou have challenged the judge, you have challenged us, and I accept those challenges as being sincere and not personal. I don\u2019t think anybody crossed the line with the judge in terms of trying to demean her as a person.\u201d\nA SENATORIAL HUG\nThe committee\u2019s top Democrat, Senator Dianne Feinstein, praised Graham for the manner in which he conducted the hearing. Feinstein and Graham then hugged at the end of the hearing. The liberal activist group Demand Justice afterward called on Feinstein to step down as the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat.\nThe committee heard from two representatives from the American Bar Association, a national nonpartisan lawyers\u2019 group that deemed Barrett \u201cwell qualified\u201d after an evaluation of her \u201cintegrity, professional competence and judicial temperament.\u201d\nSlideshow ( 8 images )\nDemocratic senators again raised a number of misgivings about Barrett\u2019s potential votes on the Supreme Court on matters ranging from gun control to criminal justice matters, and expressed concern that she avoided answering many critical questions including whether a president can delay an election and queries related to transitions of power.\n\u201cWhat was the purpose of this hearing if we\u2019ve reached the point now where we really don\u2019t know what she thinks about any issues?\u201d Democratic Senator Dick Durbin asked.\n\u201cI would be afraid to ask her about the presence of gravity on Earth. She may decline to answer because it may come up in a case - you know, it could come before the court some day,\u201d Durbin added.\nSlideshow ( 8 images )\nDemocrats were upset that Senate Republicans proceeded with the confirmation process for Trump\u2019s nominee so close to an election after refusing to act on Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 Supreme Court nominee because it was an election year.\nDemocratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said Americans want the winner of the election to decide who fills the court\u2019s vacancy created by the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\nIf confirmed, Barrett could be on the Supreme Court in time to participate in a Nov. 10 case in which Trump and Republican-led states are seeking to invalidate the 2010 Obamacare law, formally called the Affordable Care Act.",
            "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Senate Judiciary Committee convened on Thursday set an Oct. 22 vote on Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s Supreme Court nomination as Republicans race to confirm President Donald Trump\u2019s pick before the Nov. 3 election.\nThe session is without Barrett after two long days of public testimony in which she stressed that she would be her own judge and sought to create distance between herself and past positions critical of abortion, the Affordable Care Act and other issues.\nHer confirmation to take the seat of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg seems inevitable, as even some Senate Democrats acknowledged.\nSen. Lindsey Graham pushed past Democratic objections to set the panel\u2019s Oct. 22 vote on recommending her confirmation even before final witnesses testify before and against her nomination.

She could be on the court when it hears the latest Republican-led challenge on Nov. 10.\nBarrett is the most open opponent of abortion nominated to the Supreme Court in decades, and Democrats fear that her ascension could be a tipping point that threatens abortion rights.\nThere was no hiding her views in at least three letters and ads she signed over 15 years and her membership in Notre Dame\u2019s Faculty for Life.

            "With a vote date set, the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday debated the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court, Democrats objecting to Republicans' rush to confirm President Donald Trump's pick before the Nov. 3 election.\nThe committee set an Oct. 22 vote to recommend Barrett\u2019s nomination and send it to the full Senate for a vote by month's end.\n\u201cIf anybody in America is ready to go to the Supreme Court\u201d it's Barrett, said Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\nDemocrats tried, and failed, as the minority party to halt the process.\n\u201cThis is a sham,\u201d said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., arguing the Senate should wait until after the election and allow the winner of the presidency to chose the nominee for the vacant seat.\nThe session is without Barrett after two long days of public testimony in which she stressed that she would be her own judge and sought to create distance between herself and past positions critical of abortion, the Affordable Care Act and other issues.\nHer confirmation to take the seat of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg seems inevitable, as even some Senate Democrats acknowledged.\nGraham pushed past Democratic objections and procedural moves to set the panel's Oct. 22 vote on recommending her confirmation even before final witnesses testify before and against her nomination.\nIn the minority, Democrats acknowledge there is little they can do stop them from locking a conservative majority on the court for years to come. The shift would cement a 6-3 conservative majority on the court and would be the most pronounced ideological change in 30 years, from the liberal icon to the conservative appeals court judge.\nRepublicans insisted they were well within norms with Trump as president. But no court nominee has ever been confirmed so close to a presidential election. Democratic called it a \u201cpower grab\u201d and violation of Senate traditions.\nFacing almost 20 hours of questions from senators, the 48-year-old judge was careful not to take on the president who nominated her and sought to separate herself from writings on controversial subjects when she was an academic. She skipped past Democrats\u2019 pressing questions about ensuring the date of next month's election or preventing voter intimidation, both set in federal law, and the peaceful transfer of presidential power.\nShe also refused to express her view on whether the president can pardon himself. \u201cIt\u2019s not one that I can offer a view,\u201d she said in response to a question Wednesday from Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont.\nDemocrats raised those questions because President Donald Trump has done so himself.\nWhen it came to major issues that are likely to come before the court, including abortion and health care, Barrett repeatedly promised to keep an open mind and said neither Trump nor anyone else in the White House had tried to influence her views.\n\u201cNo one has elicited from me any commitment in a case,\u201d she said.\nNominees typically resist offering any more information than they have to, especially when the president\u2019s party controls the Senate, as it does now. But Barrett wouldn\u2019t engage on topics that seemed easy to swat away, including that only Congress can change the date that the election takes place.\nShe said she is not on a \u201cmission to destroy the Affordable Care Act,\u201d though she has been critical of the two Supreme Court decisions that preserved key parts of the Obama-era health care law. She could be on the court when it hears the latest Republican-led challenge on Nov. 10.\nBarrett is the most open opponent of abortion nominated to the Supreme Court in decades, and Democrats fear that her ascension could be a tipping point that threatens abortion rights.\nThere was no hiding her views in at least three letters and ads she signed over 15 years and her membership in Notre Dame\u2019s Faculty for Life. So Republican senators embraced her stance, proudly stating that she was, in Graham's words, an \u201cunashamedly pro-life\u201d conservative who is making history as a role model for other women.\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said there \u201cis nothing wrong with confirming a devout pro-life Christian.\u201d\nBarrett refused to say whether the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade ruling on abortion rights was correctly decided, though she signed an open letter seven years ago that called the decision \u201cinfamous.\u201d\nIn an exchange with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Barrett resisted the invitation to explicitly endorse or reject the late Justice Antonin Scalia's comments about perpetuating \u201cracial entitlement\u201d in a key voting rights case.\n\u201cWhen I said that Justice Scalia\u2019s philosophy is mine, too, I certainly didn\u2019t mean to say that every sentence that came out of Justice Scalia\u2019s mouth or every sentence that he wrote is one that I would agree with,\u201d Barrett said.\nShe called the Voting Rights Act a \u201ctriumph in the civil rights movement,\u201d without discussing the specifics of the earlier challenge to it. The court will hear another challenge to the law early next year.\nOne of the more dramatic moments came late Wednesday when Barrett told California Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, that she wouldn't say whether racial discrimination in voting still exists nor express a view on climate change.\nHarris asked if she agreed with Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote in a 2013 voting rights case that \u201cvoting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that.\u201d\nBarrett said she would \u201cnot comment on what any justice said in an opinion.\u201d\nAsked whether \u201cclimate change is happening,\u201d Barrett said she wouldn't engage because it is \u201ca very contentious matter of public debate.\u201d Barrett did, however, say she believes the novel coronavirus is infectious and that smoking causes cancer.\nAlong with trying to undo the health care law, Trump has publicly stated he wants a justice seated for any disputes arising from the election, and particularly the surge of mail-in ballots expected during the pandemic as voters prefer to vote by mail.\nBarrett testified she has not spoken to Trump or his team about election cases, and declined to commit to recusing herself from any post-election cases.\nIn 2000, the court's decision in Bush v. Gore brought a Florida recount to a halt, effectively deciding the election in George W. Bush's favor. Barrett was on Bush's legal team in 2000, in a minor role.\n.",
            "The Senate Judiciary Committee set a date to vote to confirm Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett after three days of hearings.\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham set October 22 as the date for the vote Thursday morning, despite pushback from Democrats, as Republicans are trying to confirm Barrett before the November 3 election.

        "context": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-led U.S. Senate on Thursday moved a step closer to confirming President Donald Trump\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court choice Amy Coney Barrett, with the Judiciary Committee scheduling an Oct. 22 vote on her nomination despite Democratic objections. The fourth and final day of the committee\u2019s confirmation hearing for the conservative appellate judge wrapped up with testimony from outside experts. Democrats protested what they called the rushed nature of the proceedings and complained that Barrett had sidestepped questions about presidential powers, abortion, climate change, voting rights and Obamacare. Republicans are aiming for a final confirmation vote on the Senate floor by the end of October following next week\u2019s committee vote. \u201cI believe that this rushed, sham process is a disservice to our committee,\u201d Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said. \u201cShe has been rushed in a way that is historically unprecedented ... and the purpose of doing it is simply to have a justice on the Supreme Court, as the president said, to decide the election and to strike down the Affordable Care Act.\u201d The Republican president has asked the Senate to confirm Barrett before the Nov. 3 U.S. election in which he is seeking a second term in office. Trump has said he expects the court to decide the election\u2019s outcome. With Republicans holding a 53-47 Senate majority, her confirmation seems assured. Barrett\u2019s confirmation would give the Supreme Court a 6-3 conservative majority. Barrett, 48, could serve for decades, alongside Trump\u2019s two other Supreme Court selections, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. \u201cThere is no way you will ever convince me that Amy Coney Barrett is not qualified, using any reasonable standards of qualification,\u201d said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, the committee chairman. Barrett answered questions from senators during marathon sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday. Outside witnesses testified in favor and against Barrett\u2019s nomination on Thursday. Barrett was not present. Despite some tense moments, the hearing was conducted largely with a congenial tone. It stood in contrast to the Kavanaugh\u2019s contentious 2018 confirmation hearings in which he angrily denied sexual assault allegations. At the end, Graham told the Democratic senators, \u201cYou have challenged the judge, you have challenged us, and I accept those challenges as being sincere and not personal. I don\u2019t think anybody crossed the line with the judge in terms of trying to demean her as a person.\u201d A SENATORIAL HUG The committee\u2019s top Democrat, Senator Dianne Feinstein, praised Graham for the manner in which he conducted the hearing. Feinstein and Graham then hugged at the end of the hearing. The liberal activist group Demand Justice afterward called on Feinstein to step down as the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat. The committee heard from two representatives from the American Bar Association, a national nonpartisan lawyers\u2019 group that deemed Barrett \u201cwell qualified\u201d after an evaluation of her \u201cintegrity, professional competence and judicial temperament.\u201d Slideshow ( 8 images ) Democratic senators again raised a number of misgivings about Barrett\u2019s potential votes on the Supreme Court on matters ranging from gun control to criminal justice matters, and expressed concern that she avoided answering many critical questions including whether a president can delay an election and queries related to transitions of power. \u201cWhat was the purpose of this hearing if we\u2019ve reached the point now where we really don\u2019t know what she thinks about any issues?\u201d Democratic Senator Dick Durbin asked. \u201cI would be afraid to ask her about the presence of gravity on Earth. She may decline to answer because it may come up in a case - you know, it could come before the court some day,\u201d Durbin added. Slideshow ( 8 images ) Democrats were upset that Senate Republicans proceeded with the confirmation process for Trump\u2019s nominee so close to an election after refusing to act on Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 Supreme Court nominee because it was an election year. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said Americans want the winner of the election to decide who fills the court\u2019s vacancy created by the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. If confirmed, Barrett could be on the Supreme Court in time to participate in a Nov. 10 case in which Trump and Republican-led states are seeking to invalidate the 2010 Obamacare law, formally called the Affordable Care Act.",
        "summarized_context": "The Republican-led U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled an Oct. 22 vote on the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, despite objections from Democrats. The committee's decision came after four days of confirmation hearings, during which Democrats criticized the rushed nature of the proceedings and Barrett's refusal to answer questions on key issues. Republicans are aiming for a final confirmation vote on the Senate floor by the end of October. With Republicans holding a majority in the Senate, Barrett's confirmation seems assured, which would give the Supreme Court a 6-3 conservative majority. Democrats have expressed concerns that Barrett's confirmation could threaten abortion rights and the Affordable Care Act. Barrett has promised to keep an open mind on major issues that may come before the court, including abortion and healthcare. The committee's decision to move forward with the confirmation process has been met with criticism from Democrats, who argue that the nomination should wait until after the election. However, Republicans argue that they are well within their rights to confirm a nominee before the election."

            "Senate Armed Services Chair Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) said that while he agrees with Trump on Section 230, the provision \u201chas nothing to do with the military.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do it in this bill. That\u2019s not a part of the bill,\u201d Inhofe said, adding that he has conveyed that belief to Trump.\nIn a pair of tweets Tuesday evening, Trump threatened to veto the bill if it does not include a full repeal of Section 230, which he has criticized as an unfair protection for social media companies whom the president believes are biased against him.\n\u201cAt this last minute, this sudden threat on an item that\u2019s not even part of a defense bill. \u2026 I don\u2019t think we could do it in a thoughtful, logical way at all,\u201d Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told POLITICO.\n\u201cIt seems to be more out of spite than anything else,\u201d Reed said of the president\u2019s threat, warning that Trump\u2019s posture jeopardizes several important policy moves, including a pay raise for U.S. troops.\nThe House is also set to move forward with a compromise defense bill that doesn\u2019t alter Section 230, according to two House Democratic aides.\nThe president\u2019s Twitter broadside puts Republicans in a bind as they look to maintain the support of Trump and his base heading into the Georgia runoffs next month that will determine control of the Senate. If GOP lawmakers back Trump, they risk tanking the popular military policy bill that's become law each year for nearly six decades; if they buck him by ignoring his complaints or overriding a veto, they risk stoking Trump\u2019s ire.\nStill, Republicans on Wednesday showed some signs of exasperation with the president\u2019s latest effort. As one GOP lawmaker put it: \u201cRepublicans are sick of this shit.\u201d\nAnother Republican, Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, put it more delicately. While he said he understood the president\u2019s frustrations with Section 230, it was not worth imperiling the broader defense bill.\n\u201cThe NDAA is so important to the men and women that wear the uniform that this should not be an item to veto the act over,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I would hope he would reconsider his position on it.\u201d\nAnd Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said his \u201cpreference\u201d would be to pass the NDAA and then address Section 230 separately.\nSome lawmakers are already working with the White House to try to address the president\u2019s demands. Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, said he submitted possible legislative language to the White House on Section 230.\n\u201cThis was not an idea I had advocated. I\u2019m simply trying to be of assistance to the committee \u2026 and to the administration,\u201d Wicker said, adding that he doesn\u2019t believe the president will ultimately veto the NDAA.\nThe top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, retiring Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, urged lawmakers to close ranks and pass the bill.\n\u201dThe purpose of the bill has always been to support our troops and to protect American national security,\u201d Thornberry said in a statement. \u201dDisagreements on all other issues have been put aside. This year should be no different.\u201d\nNot all of Trump's allies on Capitol Hill want him to back off from a fight on the defense bill.\n\u201cI hope we can do it,\u201d said Senate Judiciary Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). \u201cIf I were him, I\u2019d use all the leverage I could.\u201d\nSome Senate Republicans have been pushing to include changes to the online shield short of repeal in the defense bill. Separately, Graham\u2019s panel is slated to vote on a bill Wednesday to alter Section 230.\nTrump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, indicated Trump may be open to curbing the law.\n\u201dRight now they\u2019re getting a free ride to be editors and publishers to censor certain conservative messages,\u201d Kudlow said in an interview on Fox Business. \u201dWe don\u2019t like that one bit, and the president believes the NDAA is one way to amend that and make it better.\n\u201dHe\u2019s not dictating the language yet, but he wants an amendment that would essentially curb in one way shape or form the unbridled liability protection shield that these firms have,\u201d Kudlow added.\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a co-sponsor of the only bipartisan bill targeting Section 230 to advance out of committee this Congress, called the veto threat \u201ddeeply dangerous and just plain stupid.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cReforming Section 230 deserves its own debate \u2014 one that I\u2019ve helped lead in Congress, and which I look forward to continuing with a more serious, thoughtful administration in January.\u201d\nBlumenthal\u2019s bill, the EARN IT Act, would puncture a hole in the Section 230 immunity by opening online companies up to federal and state civil lawsuits for hosting child porn.\nThe Section 230 push is the second time Trump has threatened to nix the defense bill this year. Over the summer, Trump promised to veto any defense legislation that would remove the names of Confederate leaders from 10 Army bases, even though provisions that would rename bases were included in both House and Senate bills with bipartisan support.\nThe final defense bill does include a provision that would spur the Pentagon to remove the names over a three-year period, according to an aide for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who authored the proposal. The provision was included in the Senate-passed bill.\nRenaming bases has been one of the thornier issues for negotiators, with Democrats digging in against Trump. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) reiterated that the provision is a deal-breaker for Democrats.\nMorning Defense The latest news in defense policy and politics.

Even though negotiations have been ongoing for months between the leaders of the Senate and House Armed Services committees and their staffs, the procedural move is needed to formally bring a final defense bill up for a vote.\nThe NDAA is expected to be one of the last major pieces of legislation that passes this year, and during Trump's presidency. Lawmakers are aiming to leave the nation\u2019s capital in the coming days ahead of the holidays, but must still work out a funding deal to stave off a government shutdown by the end of next week. Congressional leaders are also eyeing another round of coronavirus economic relief that has been stalled for months.\n\u201cName a time that it's not this way,\u201d Graham said. \u201cName a time where we\u2019re done Dec. 1, go home and enjoy Christmas. I mean, it\u2019s always this way.\u201d\nBurgess Everett, Sarah Ferris, Heather Caygle, Melanie Zanona and Cristiano Lima contributed to this report.",
            "\u00a9 Provided by Washington Examiner\nLawmakers in both parties are set to defy President Trump\u2019s threat to veto a key defense policy bill over military base names and social media liability protection.\nTrump tweeted on Monday that he\u2019ll veto the 2021 Defense Authorization Act, which sets annual spending levels and policy for the military unless it includes a new provision to strip a federal liability shield from social media companies, which he believes have worked to silence him and other conservative voices on Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms.\nTrump also wants to rid the defense bill of a provision authored by former presidential campaign opponent Sen. Elizabeth Warren calling for the renaming of U.S. military bases that are currently named after Confederate military officers.\nBut House and Senate lawmakers said that despite Trump\u2019s looming opposition, they aren\u2019t interested in a partisan battle over the must-pass measure, and the defense bill appears poised to pass, likely this month.\nThe National Defense Authorization Act is among a trio of priority legislation that includes fiscal 2021 spending and a critical coronavirus aid package lawmakers are rushing to negotiate by year's end.\nSen. James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said the National Defense Authorization Act is poised to pass this month with at least two-thirds support from the Senate, which would provide a veto-proof majority.\n\u201cThis is going to pass,\u201d Inhofe told reporters on Wednesday.\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, is also ready to bring the defense bill up for a vote in the House, a senior Democratic aide told the Washington Examiner. While the timing of the vote is not set, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he is aiming to complete House business for the year by Dec. 11.\nTrump has threatened to veto the defense bill over the base name change provision.\nIn July, Trump tweeted that Inhofe assured him the Warren provision would not be included in the bill.\n\u201cLike me, Jim is not a believer in \u2018Cancel Culture,\u2019\u201d Trump tweeted on July 24.\nBut Inhofe confirmed on Wednesday that the Warren provision remains in the bill to ensure Democratic support.\nInhofe said he agrees with Trump\u2019s criticism of the social media liability shield, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. But Inhofe said it should remain out of the defense bill because adding it will prompt House Democrats to refuse to draft a critical compromise bill between the House and Senate versions.\n\u201cI feel just as passionate about that as he does,\u201d Inhofe told reporters. \u201cThe only difference of opinion that we have is, I don't want it on this bill \u2026 because the Democrats will not appoint conferees\u201d to draft a compromise.\nSection 230 provides websites and social media sites broad protection from lawsuits while also allowing them to remove or moderate content.\nTrump and other Republicans have grown increasingly critical of Section 230 in the wake of incidents involving the removal or editing of content posted by conservatives and the president.\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee, run by Republicans, summoned the CEOs of Facebook and Twitter prior to the election to explain why they blocked a New York Post story about an alleged trove of Hunter Biden emails that suggested the family corruptly cashes in on its relationship to Joe Biden.\nRepublicans accused the social media companies of utilizing their platforms to hurt Trump and help Biden.\n\u201cThere is growing bipartisan concern with Big Tech and their abuse of power, and Section 230 is in serious need of reform,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican.\nRepublicans said on Wednesday that while they agree the shield law needs to be revised, the work should happen in the Senate Commerce Committee, not the Armed Services Committee.\nThey are also opposed to delaying passage of the bill, which authorizes spending levels and is critical for military planning.\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably a more appropriate place to do it,\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, told the Washington Examiner. \u201cOur military deserve to have authorization.\u201d\nThe Warren provision has already garnered bipartisan support.\nIn a media call with reporters on Wednesday, Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, said he would be \u201creluctant to put the bill on the floor\u201d without it.\nHe called Trump\u2019s reluctance to rename the bases \u201ca racist position to take, an extraordinarily unfortunate position for the president's take.\u201d\nBut some polls show Trump sides with a majority of the public.\nAn ABC News-Ipsos poll taken in June found 56% opposed changing Confederate-named military bases, compared to 42% who backed making the changes.\nAmong those surveyed, 67% of black people and 54% of Hispanics supported renaming those bases.\nTags: News, Congress\nOriginal Author: Susan Ferrechio\nOriginal Location: Trump-weary Congress moves to circumvent defense bill veto threat",
            "Trump threw the annual, must-pass measure authorizing the military\u2019s operations into disarray late Tuesday with a pair of tweets taking aim at Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields technology companies from legal liability for the content posted by their users. Trump said the law should be \u201ccompletely terminated,\u201d claiming it is a national security risk. On Wednesday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany stressed to reporters that the president is \u201cserious\u201d about his threat to veto the legislation absent a repeal of 230.\nAD\nAD\nBut the overwhelming response from Congress \u2014 and notably, from Republicans \u2014 was unyielding.\n\u201c[Section] 230 has nothing to do with the military,\u201d Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), a Trump ally. \u201cI agree with his sentiments, we ought to do away with 230 \u2014 but you can\u2019t do it in this bill.\u201d\nSome Republicans were even more pointed about their disdain for what many lawmakers viewed as an 11th hour stunt.\n\u201cI will vote to override,\u201d Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), an Air Force veteran, wrote on Twitter in response to Trump\u2019s veto threat. \u201cBecause it\u2019s really not about you.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s fixation with rescinding Section 230 reflects the White House\u2019s ongoing war with Facebook, Google and Twitter over allegations they are biased against conservatives \u2014 charges that the three tech giants deny. The president has ratcheted up his attacks against Silicon Valley in recent months as they have taken steps to flag misleading content more forcefully \u2014 including Trump\u2019s myriad false contentions about the 2020 election.\nAD\nAD\nSection 230 covers a diverse array of digital services, including large social-networking sites, newer conservative outlets like Parler, as well as mainstream news outlets including The Post. There is bipartisan agreement that Section 230 as it stands is outdated, and warrants reform \u2014 especially at a time when toxic, harmful content can spread virally at the ease of a click. But lawmakers have bristled at a full-scale repeal \u2014 and at the administration\u2019s attempts to shoehorn it into the defense bill.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the defense bill is the place to litigate that,\u201d Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the Senate Republican Whip, told reporters Wednesday. \u201cWe have to pass the defense authorization bill. \u2026 It\u2019s the most important thing, arguably, that we do around here.\u201d\nThis week marks the second time Trump has threatened to withhold his signature from this year\u2019s bill, a measure Congress has passed for the last 59 years. The first time, in July, he pledged to oppose any defense bill that included an instruction to the Pentagon to change the names of military installations named after prominent Confederate leaders.\nAD\nAD\nBoth the House and the Senate passed versions of the defense bill over the summer that included such a mandate. Both passed by veto-proof majorities.\nNonetheless, Trump\u2019s first veto threat set off a scramble in Congress, as Inhofe and other Republicans sought to accommodate his demands. In the end, there was no capitulation to the president: the negotiated bicameral version of the bill, completed Wednesday, includes an order to change the base names within three years of the legislation\u2019s passage.\nTrump also has not repeated his threat to veto the defense bill over the Confederate naming provision since the negotiations were completed.\nOn Wednesday, copies of the compromise bill \u2014 without any repeal of Section 230 \u2014 began circulating among negotiators for their approval and signature. A senior Democratic aide said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) was ready to put the legislation on the floor.\nAD\nAD\nThat leaves Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) standing between the coalescing will of Congress and the temper of the outgoing president.\nMcConnell is not known for daring the president when he has issued explicit veto threats. The closest he came to doing so was in 2017, when he had the Senate vote on a package of sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea after then-White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci told CNN he \u201cmay sign the sanctions exactly the way they are, or he may veto the sanctions.\u201d\nThe Senate has voted on a series of war powers resolutions despite Trump\u2019s threat to veto them, but those were \u201cprivileged\u201d measures that McConnell could not have prevented from consideration.\nAD\nIt is also rare for the Senate leader to flout the will of his committee chairs \u2014 especially when doing so might deep-six the defense bill, which he too believes is a must-pass piece of legislation.\nAD\nRepublicans close to the president have been working urgently to see if they can get Trump to back off his threat, or come up with an off-ramp to placate the president and avoid the dramatic spectacle of a veto clash so close to the end of the year and Trump\u2019s presidency.\nThough Trump has fixated on the defense bill, there are several other arenas on Capitol Hill in which Section 230 is being debated this week.\nOn Wednesday, a panel of Senate Republicans advanced the nomination of Nathan Simington to serve as a new GOP member on the Federal Communications Commission, overriding Democratic objections about his political independence. Simington played a critical role in crafting an executive order earlier this year that aimed to expand the government\u2019s power to police political speech on the Web. The widely panned directive has been challenged since over its constitutionality.\nAD\nAD\nOn Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee also is expected to debate legislation taking aim at the Section 230 law. When asked about Trump\u2019s veto threat, the chairman of that committee, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), said: \u201cI support him using all the leverage he can.\u201d\nA full repeal of Section 230, as Trump envisions, would have vast implications for the future of free expression. Its protections against lawsuits offer social networking sites the legal runway to moderate their services as they see fit, according to legal experts, who predicted a repeal could ultimately end up hurting Trump and his allies.",
            "WASHINGTON \u2014 Leading Republicans and Democrats in Congress said on Wednesday that they would press ahead in advancing an annual military policy bill without adding a repeal demanded by President Trump of a legal shield for social media companies, defying his threat to veto the legislation over the unrelated issue.\nRepublicans\u2019 determination to advance the measure over Mr. Trump\u2019s objections amounted to a rare refusal by his allies on Capitol Hill to accommodate the president\u2019s hard-line stance, which has threatened to imperil the bill that authorizes pay raises for American troops. And it raised the prospect of a possible veto showdown in the final weeks of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 on a popular measure that has not failed to pass in 60 years.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it on this bill, because we can\u2019t have a bill if that language is on it,\u201d said Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, describing what he told the president about the legal liability provision. \u201cWe just had an honest disagreement, very friendly.\u201d\nMr. Trump threatened in July to veto the legislation over a provision requiring the removal of Confederate leaders\u2019 names from military bases, a measure that drew broad bipartisan support and was included in both the House and Senate versions of the bill. But with his time in office winding down, the president has become increasingly fixated on the idea of using the popular, must-pass legislation to repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which protects platforms like Facebook and YouTube from being sued over much of the content posted by their users, and how they choose to take that content down.",
            "Congress is moving forward on a must-pass defense policy bill without repealing a legal shield for social media companies, rejecting a last-minute veto threat from President Donald Trump.\nThe final version of the National Defense Authorization Act that will soon be considered by the House and Senate won\u2019t include Trump\u2019s long-sought repeal of the legal immunity for online companies, known as Section 230, according to lawmakers and aides.\nRepublicans also made clear they weren\u2019t going to bend to Trump.\nSenate Armed Services Chair Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) said that while he agrees with Trump on Section 230, the provision \u201chas nothing to do with the military.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do it in this bill. That\u2019s not a part of the bill,\u201d Inhofe said, adding that he has conveyed that belief to Trump.\nIn a pair of tweets Tuesday evening, Trump threatened to veto the bill if it does not include a full repeal of Section 230, which he has criticized as an unfair protection for social media companies whom the president believes are biased against him.\n\u201cAt this last minute, this sudden threat on an item that\u2019s not even part of a defense bill. \u2026 I don\u2019t think we could do it in a thoughtful, logical way at all,\u201d Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told POLITICO.\n\u201cIt seems to be more out of spite than anything else,\u201d Reed said of the president\u2019s threat, warning that Trump\u2019s posture jeopardizes several important policy moves, including a pay raise for U.S. troops.\nThe House is also set to move forward with a compromise defense bill that doesn\u2019t alter Section 230, according to two House Democratic aides.\nThe president\u2019s Twitter broadside puts Republicans in a bind as they look to maintain the support of Trump and his base heading into the Georgia runoffs next month that will determine control of the Senate. If GOP lawmakers back Trump, they risk tanking the popular military policy bill that's become law each year for nearly six decades; if they buck him by ignoring his complaints or overriding a veto, they risk stoking Trump\u2019s ire.\nStory continues\nStill, Republicans on Wednesday showed some signs of exasperation with the president\u2019s latest effort. As one GOP lawmaker put it: \u201cRepublicans are sick of this shit.\u201d\nAnother Republican, Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, put it more delicately. While he said he understood the president\u2019s frustrations with Section 230, it was not worth imperiling the broader defense bill.\n\u201cThe NDAA is so important to the men and women that wear the uniform that this should not be an item to veto the act over,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I would hope he would reconsider his position on it.\u201d\nAnd Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said his \u201cpreference\u201d would be to pass the NDAA and then address Section 230 separately.\nSome lawmakers are already working with the White House to try to address the president\u2019s demands. Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, said he submitted possible legislative language to the White House on Section 230.\n\u201cThis was not an idea I had advocated. I\u2019m simply trying to be of assistance to the committee \u2026 and to the administration,\u201d Wicker said, adding that he doesn\u2019t believe the president will ultimately veto the NDAA.\nThe top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, retiring Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, urged lawmakers to close ranks and pass the bill.\n\u201dThe purpose of the bill has always been to support our troops and to protect American national security,\u201d Thornberry said in a statement. \u201dDisagreements on all other issues have been put aside. This year should be no different.\u201d\nNot all of Trump's allies on Capitol Hill want him to back off from a fight on the defense bill.\n\u201cI hope we can do it,\u201d said Senate Judiciary Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). \u201cIf I were him, I\u2019d use all the leverage I could.\u201d\nSome Senate Republicans have been pushing to include changes to the online shield short of repeal in the defense bill. Separately, Graham\u2019s panel is slated to vote on a bill Wednesday to alter Section 230.\nTrump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, indicated Trump may be open to curbing the law.\n\u201dRight now they\u2019re getting a free ride to be editors and publishers to censor certain conservative messages,\u201d Kudlow said in an interview on Fox Business. \u201dWe don\u2019t like that one bit, and the president believes the NDAA is one way to amend that and make it better.\n\u201dHe\u2019s not dictating the language yet, but he wants an amendment that would essentially curb in one way shape or form the unbridled liability protection shield that these firms have,\u201d Kudlow added.\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a co-sponsor of the only bipartisan bill targeting Section 230 to advance out of committee this Congress, called the veto threat \u201ddeeply dangerous and just plain stupid.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cReforming Section 230 deserves its own debate \u2014 one that I\u2019ve helped lead in Congress, and which I look forward to continuing with a more serious, thoughtful administration in January.\u201d\nBlumenthal\u2019s bill, the EARN IT Act, would puncture a hole in the Section 230 immunity by opening online companies up to federal and state civil lawsuits for hosting child porn.\nThe Section 230 push is the second time Trump has threatened to nix the defense bill this year. Over the summer, Trump promised to veto any defense legislation that would remove the names of Confederate leaders from 10 Army bases, even though provisions that would rename bases were included in both House and Senate bills with bipartisan support.\nThe final defense bill does include a provision that would spur the Pentagon to remove the names over a three-year period, according to an aide for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who authored the proposal. The provision was included in the Senate-passed bill.\nRenaming bases has been one of the thornier issues for negotiators, with Democrats digging in against Trump. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) reiterated that the provision is a deal-breaker for Democrats.\n\u201cIf that language is not included in the defense bill \u2026 I would be reluctant to put that bill on the floor,\u201d Hoyer told reporters.\nThe Senate finally agreed Wednesday to name its slate of members to formal talks with the House on a compromise defense bill. Even though negotiations have been ongoing for months between the leaders of the Senate and House Armed Services committees and their staffs, the procedural move is needed to formally bring a final defense bill up for a vote.\nThe NDAA is expected to be one of the last major pieces of legislation that passes this year, and during Trump's presidency. Lawmakers are aiming to leave the nation\u2019s capital in the coming days ahead of the holidays, but must still work out a funding deal to stave off a government shutdown by the end of next week. Congressional leaders are also eyeing another round of coronavirus economic relief that has been stalled for months.\n\u201cName a time that it's not this way,\u201d Graham said. \u201cName a time where we\u2019re done Dec. 1, go home and enjoy Christmas. I mean, it\u2019s always this way.\u201d\nBurgess Everett, Sarah Ferris, Heather Caygle, Melanie Zanona and Cristiano Lima contributed to this report.",
            "Congress is poised to defy President Trump\u2019s Twitter veto threat and pass the defense policy bill without changes to the law governing social media companies that the president demanded.\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman James Inhofe on Wednesday said the final bill does not include measures that would strip liability protection for internet companies, as Mr. Trump wanted.\nMr. Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican, said he broke the news to Mr. Trump, telling him such internet policy does not belong in the Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which sets military policy and the Pentagon\u2019s yearly budget.\n\u201cOnly difference of opinion that I have is I don\u2019t want it on this bill because we can\u2019t have a bill with that language on it,\u201d he told reporters on Capitol Hill.\nHe said that he and Mr. Trump had an \u201chonest disagreement,\u201d but the conversation was \u201cvery friendly.\u201d\nMr. Trump tweeted Tuesday evening that he would veto the NDAA unless it includes language to repeal Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which protects companies that can host trillions of messages from being sued into oblivion by anyone who feels wronged by something someone else has posted \u2014 whether their complaint is legitimate or not.\nHe called Section 230, \u201ca serious threat to our National Security & Election Integrity,\u201d and said, \u201cTherefore, if the very dangerous & unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), I will be forced to unequivocally VETO the Bill.\u201d\nThe $740.5 billion bill has been passed by Congress every year for more than five decades, and Mr. Inhofe said this year should be no different.

He is going to put pressure on Congress to step up on this.\u201d\nMr. Trump has threatened to veto the massive defense legislation more than once, as his primary criticism of the bill stems from language that would mandate the names of 10 military bases that honor Confederate leaders be changed.\nMr. Inhofe confirmed that the legislation, sponsored by Ms. Warren, made it into the final version of the NDAA. It remains unclear whether the full bill will receive a veto-proof majority.\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.

That\u2019s not a part of the bill,\u201d Inhofe said, adding that he has conveyed that belief to Trump. In a pair of tweets Tuesday evening, Trump threatened to veto the bill if it does not include a full repeal of Section 230, which he has criticized as an unfair protection for social media companies whom the president believes are biased against him. \u201cAt this last minute, this sudden threat on an item that\u2019s not even part of a defense bill. \u2026 I don\u2019t think we could do it in a thoughtful, logical way at all,\u201d Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told POLITICO. \u201cIt seems to be more out of spite than anything else,\u201d Reed said of the president\u2019s threat, warning that Trump\u2019s posture jeopardizes several important policy moves, including a pay raise for U.S. troops. The House is also set to move forward with a compromise defense bill that doesn\u2019t alter Section 230, according to two House Democratic aides. The president\u2019s Twitter broadside puts Republicans in a bind as they look to maintain the support of Trump and his base heading into the Georgia runoffs next month that will determine control of the Senate. If GOP lawmakers back Trump, they risk tanking the popular military policy bill that's become law each year for nearly six decades; if they buck him by ignoring his complaints or overriding a veto, they risk stoking Trump\u2019s ire. Still, Republicans on Wednesday showed some signs of exasperation with the president\u2019s latest effort. As one GOP lawmaker put it: \u201cRepublicans are sick of this shit.\u201d Another Republican, Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, put it more delicately. While he said he understood the president\u2019s frustrations with Section 230, it was not worth imperiling the broader defense bill. \u201cThe NDAA is so important to the men and women that wear the uniform that this should not be an item to veto the act over,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I would hope he would reconsider his position on it.\u201d And Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said his \u201cpreference\u201d would be to pass the NDAA and then address Section 230 separately. Some lawmakers are already working with the White House to try to address the president\u2019s demands. Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, said he submitted possible legislative language to the White House on Section 230. \u201cThis was not an idea I had advocated. I\u2019m simply trying to be of assistance to the committee \u2026 and to the administration,\u201d Wicker said, adding that he doesn\u2019t believe the president will ultimately veto the NDAA. The top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, retiring Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, urged lawmakers to close ranks and pass the bill. \u201dThe purpose of the bill has always been to support our troops and to protect American national security,\u201d Thornberry said in a statement. \u201dDisagreements on all other issues have been put aside. This year should be no different.\u201d Not all of Trump's allies on Capitol Hill want him to back off from a fight on the defense bill. \u201cI hope we can do it,\u201d said Senate Judiciary Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). \u201cIf I were him, I\u2019d use all the leverage I could.\u201d Some Senate Republicans have been pushing to include changes to the online shield short of repeal in the defense bill. Separately, Graham\u2019s panel is slated to vote on a bill Wednesday to alter Section 230. Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, indicated Trump may be open to curbing the law. \u201dRight now they\u2019re getting a free ride to be editors and publishers to censor certain conservative messages,\u201d Kudlow said in an interview on Fox Business. \u201dWe don\u2019t like that one bit, and the president believes the NDAA is one way to amend that and make it better. \u201dHe\u2019s not dictating the language yet, but he wants an amendment that would essentially curb in one way shape or form the unbridled liability protection shield that these firms have,\u201d Kudlow added. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a co-sponsor of the only bipartisan bill targeting Section 230 to advance out of committee this Congress, called the veto threat \u201ddeeply dangerous and just plain stupid.\u201d He added, \u201cReforming Section 230 deserves its own debate \u2014 one that I\u2019ve helped lead in Congress, and which I look forward to continuing with a more serious, thoughtful administration in January.\u201d Blumenthal\u2019s bill, the EARN IT Act, would puncture a hole in the Section 230 immunity by opening online companies up to federal and state civil lawsuits for hosting child porn. The Section 230 push is the second time Trump has threatened to nix the defense bill this year. Over the summer, Trump promised to veto any defense legislation that would remove the names of Confederate leaders from 10 Army bases, even though provisions that would rename bases were included in both House and Senate bills with bipartisan support. The final defense bill does include a provision that would spur the Pentagon to remove the names over a three-year period, according to an aide for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who authored the proposal. The provision was included in the Senate-passed bill. Renaming bases has been one of the thornier issues for negotiators, with Democrats digging in against Trump. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) reiterated that the provision is a deal-breaker for Democrats. Morning Defense The latest news in defense policy and politics.

            "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump on Wednesday pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\nTrump\u2019s pardon, which could be the first of several after he lost the 2020 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden, drew condemnation from Democrats and other critics.\nA retired Army general, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about interactions he had with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States in the weeks leading up to Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017.\nHe has since sought to withdraw the plea, arguing that prosecutors violated his rights and duped him into a plea agreement. His sentencing has been deferred several times.\n\u201cIt is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter, a day before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.\nFlynn\u2019s attorney, Sidney Powell, who told a court in September she personally asked Trump not to pardon her client, said the pardon was \u201cbittersweet\u201d because Flynn was innocent\nTrump\u2019s move was the highest-profile pardon he has granted since he took office. Among others, the Republican president has pardoned Army personnel accused of war crimes in Afghanistan and Joe Arpaio, a former Arizona sheriff and hardliner against illegal immigration.\n\u201cThis pardon is undeserved, unprincipled, and one more stain on President Trump\u2019s rapidly diminishing legacy,\u201d House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said in a statement.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it \u201can act of grave corruption and a brazen abuse of power.\u201d\nFILE PHOTO: Former national security adviser Michael Flynn exits a vehicle as he arrives for his sentencing hearing at U.S. District Court in Washington, U.S., December 18, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\nMUELLER INVESTIGATION\nFlynn served as Trump\u2019s first national security adviser but the president fired him after only 24 days for lying to Vice President Mike Pence as controversy broke over the former general\u2019s contacts with then-Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak.\nFlynn was one of several former Trump aides to plead guilty or be convicted at trial in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Moscow\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. election to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy. Russia denied meddling.\nIn May, Attorney General William Barr stunned many in the legal community by ordering prosecutors to have the case dropped, a decision that came after Trump repeatedly complained that Flynn was being treated unfairly.\nFlynn and the Trump administration said U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who presided over the case, was required by law to grant the request for dismissal. An appeals court in August denied Flynn\u2019s request to order Sullivan to end the case.\n\u201cThe President has pardoned General Flynn because he should never have been prosecuted,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u201cIn fact, the Department of Justice has firmly concluded that the charges against General Flynn should be dropped. This Full Pardon achieves that objective, finally bringing to an end the relentless, partisan pursuit of an innocent man.\u201d\nThe president has spent the days since the Nov. 3 election seeking to overturn the results and refusing to concede to Biden. On Monday, he allowed his administration to take part in a transition to a Biden White House, but he has continued to challenge the election\u2019s legitimacy. With less than two months before Inauguration Day, he could focus his remaining time in office on more pardons and other moves to burnish his legacy.\nTwo former White House officials said more pardons were likely. \u201c\u201dThis is one unfettered presidential power the president enjoys using,\u201d one of them said.\n\u2018NOT LEARNED HIS LESSON\u2019\nTrump said in March he was strongly considering a full pardon for Flynn. He said the FBI and Justice Department had \u201cdestroyed\u201d Flynn\u2019s life and that of his family, and cited an unspecified, unsubstantiated report that they had lost records related to Flynn.\nFlynn was supposed to help cooperate with the government as part of his plea deal. But he later switched lawyers and tactics, arguing that prosecutors in the case had tricked him into lying about his December 2016 conversations with Kislyak.\nThe Justice Department has repeatedly denied allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, and Sullivan rejected all of Flynn\u2019s claims in December 2019.\nFederal prosecutors had asked the judge in January to sentence Flynn to up to six months in prison, arguing in a court filing that \u201cthe defendant has not learned his lesson. He has behaved as though the law does not apply to him, and as if there are no consequences for his actions.\u201d\nFlynn also served as head of the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Intelligence Agency but was forced out in 2014 in part due to his management style and opinions on how to fight Islamist militancy.\nHe joined the Trump 2016 election campaign and at the Republican National Convention that year led supporters in chants of \u201cLock her up,\u201d in reference to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\nOther former Trump aides were convicted of federal crimes following the Russia inquiry. Trump\u2019s longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone was sentenced on Feb. 20 to three years and four months in prison for obstruction of justice, witness tampering and lying to lawmakers investigating the Russian election interference. Trump commuted his sentence.\nPaul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, was sentenced last year to 3-1/2 years in prison after being convicted of unlawful lobbying and witness tampering, which combined with a sentence in a related case equaled a term of more than seven years behind bars. Manafort was released from prison in May and is serving the rest of his sentence at home.",

Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg/Getty Images\nPresident Trump has tweeted that he has \u201cgranted a Full Pardon\u201d to former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\u201dIt is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!\u201d Trump tweeted.\nThe Department of Justice was not consulted on the pardon but was given a heads-up on Wednesday, according to a Department of Justice official.\n\u201cWe would have preferred to see if Judge Sullivan would act and for the matter to be resolved in court. We were confident in the likelihood of our success in the case,\u201d the official said. \u201cThat being said, this is obviously an appropriate use of the President\u2019s pardon power.\u201d\nFlynn's tenure at the White House lasted just a few weeks \u2014 he resigned early 2017 after getting caught in a public lie about his Russian contacts.\nHe pleaded guilty in late 2017 to lying to the FBI about those contacts, but later disavowed his plea and tried to get the case thrown out. In a shocking twist this spring, the Justice Department abandoned the case, which is still tied up in legal limbo.\nThroughout the saga, Flynn has narrowly avoided being sentenced.\nHe's also become an emblem of Trump's persistent efforts to undermine the Russia investigation and a conduit for testing the separation of powers between judges and prosecutors.\nRep. Adam Schiff, manager of the House impeachment investigation into Trump and chairman of the House Intel Committee, reacted to Trump\u2019s pardon of Flynn this afternoon.\nSchiff said in a statement, \u201cThere is no doubt that a president has broad power to confer pardons, but when they are deployed to insulate himself, his family, and his associates from criminal investigation, it is a corruption of the Framer\u2019s intent.\u201d\nSome background: To date, Trump's record on presidential pardons has been marked by personal connections, showmanship and an aversion to going through official government channels.\nBeneficiaries have won clemency by getting their requests to Trump through friends, Fox News personalities or Hollywood celebrities who talk to the President. That unusual pipeline has worked for people like Joe Arpaio, a former Arizona sheriff, Dinesh D'Souza, right-wing commentator, and Michael Milken, a financier convicted of securities fraud.\nCNN's Christina Carrega contributed to this report.\nCNN's Kaitlan Collins has more:",
            "On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced on Twitter that he was pardoning former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was at the center of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference and alleged obstruction of justice by the president.\nIt is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 25, 2020\nThe move comes almost three years to the day after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 presidential transition, in which he convinced Russia to hold off on retaliating against the United States for sanctions related to its interference in that election. As Trump himself acknowledged at the time, Flynn lied to Vice President Mike Pence and to the FBI about that conversation, which may have violated the obscure and rarely enforced Logan Act.\nMueller was appointed special counsel after it emerged that Trump had pressured FBI Director James Comey into dropping the investigation of Flynn before firing him.\nAs part of his eventual cooperation deal with Mueller, Flynn told prosecutors that he couldn\u2019t recall whether Trump was aware at the time of the potentially illegal conversation with Kislyak. In exchange for initially cooperating, Flynn reportedly had a number of potential other charges against him dropped. Mueller also seemed to have dropped possible investigations into his son, Michael Flynn Jr.\nAfter Mueller\u2019s appointment ended, Flynn attempted to recant his guilty plea earlier this year, an issue that has continued to play out in federal court for months. Attorney General William Barr\u2019s Department of Justice also attempted to drop the proceedings against Flynn in the sentencing phase, causing members of that prosecutorial team to resign from their positions on that team. Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, though, demanded an accounting of why the DOJ took the unprecedented step of attempting to undo the guilty plea after the fact.\nThe terms of Flynn\u2019s pardon were not immediately available beyond Trump\u2019s declaration of a \u201cfull pardon\u201d and so it\u2019s unclear if that pardon covers any other possible crimes that might have been dropped under Flynn\u2019s rescinded cooperation agreement.\nIt follows a commutation earlier this year of Roger Stone, another Trump ally who was convicted for his effort to try to protect Trump and alleged to have potentially incriminating evidence on the president.\nOn Wednesday, the New York Times reported that Trump was preparing a \u201cblitz\u201d of pardons for top allies who have been indicted or convicted of crimes during his presidency, potentially including Paul Manafort, Steve Bannon, and Elliott Broidy.*\nOnce these men have been pardoned, they can be subpoenaed to testify before Congress about their crimes or possible crimes, cannot cite the Fifth Amendment in declining to testify, and can be forced to reveal the full truth about any criminal action and any possible involvement of Trump. It will be up to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler to decide how interested in the truth and accountability congressional Democrats actually are.\nOn Wednesday, Nadler accused the president of pardoning Flynn in order to potentially cover up \u201cthe President\u2019s own wrongdoing,\u201d but made no note of further action on his committee\u2019s part.\n\u201cThis pardon is part of a pattern,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cWe saw it before, in the Roger Stone case\u2014where President Trump granted clemency to protect an individual who might have implicated the President in criminal misconduct. We may see it again before President Trump finally leaves office. These actions are an abuse of power and fundamentally undermine the rule of law.\u201d\nNadler\u2019s statement, however, made no indication he had any interest in using his own very real power to uncover the facts behind these abuses of power.\n\u201cPresident-Elect Biden will soon take office and restore a measure of honor to the Office of the President,\u201d Nadler continued. \u201cBetween now and then, we must be vigilant to additional abuses of power, even as we look with hope to days to come.\u201d\nCorrection, Nov. 25, 2020: This post originally misspelled Elliott Broidy\u2019s first name.",

            "President Trump on Wednesday announced he had pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, ending a three-year legal saga that saw Flynn seek to withdraw a guilty plea for lying to the FBI and a controversial reversal by the Justice Department on his case.\nFlynn pleaded guilty to a felony in December 2017, admitting that he had misled investigators about details of his conversations with the Russian ambassador during Trump\u2019s presidential transition.\nHis plea was one of the first major courtroom victories for special counsel Robert S.

That request has been pending before a federal judge, who has been reviewing the case.\nTrump\u2019s pardon of Flynn marks a full embrace of the retired general he had ousted from the White House after only 22 days on the job \u2014 and a final salvo against the Russia investigation that shadowed the first half of his term in office.\nThe president and his allies have touted Flynn\u2019s cause in their efforts to discredit the special counsel inquiry into whether individuals associated with Trump\u2019s campaign cooperated with Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election.\nAs Wednesday, Trump tweeted, \u201cIt is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!\u201d\nFlynn is the second Trump associate caught up in the Mueller probe to benefit from the president\u2019s power to grant clemency. In July, Trump commuted the sentence of his former adviser, Roger Stone, who had been convicted of lying to Congress about his efforts to secure information from WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign.\nAfter his guilty plea in late 2017, Flynn initially cooperated with special counsel prosecutors pursuing other cases, delaying his sentencing.\nBut once Mueller\u2019s team disbanded, Flynn hired new lawyers \u2014 included attorney Sidney Powell, who this fall was briefly part of a team of Trump legal advisers working to overturn the November election results by promoting baseless conspiracy theories about fraud.\nIn the Flynn case, Powell argued that Flynn had been entrapped during his FBI interview, conducted at the White House four days after Trump took office. She maintained that he had never intended to lie and that key documents had been withheld from him by prosecutors.\nProsecutors at first continued to pursue the case, and a federal judge rejected several of Flynn\u2019s new arguments.\nBut in May, acting on instructions from Barr, the Justice Department reversed course and said a new review of the case\u2019s origins led prosecutors to conclude that Flynn\u2019s lies could not be proved in court. Because of that, the department said, they were not material to an FBI investigation of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election that was underway at the time.\nThe stunning turnaround prompted fears of politicization at the Justice Department. Barr insisted that a review of the case concluded it should be dismissed.\nRather than immediately accept that, however, District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, who has overseen the case, signaled that he wished to explore whether the Justice Department had acted properly and if Flynn was being given special treatment because he is an ally of the president.\nFlynn objected to Sullivan\u2019s handling of the case, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled the judge did not have to immediately grant the Justice Department\u2019s request to drop the matter.\nIn September, Powell told Sullivan that she had personally briefed Trump on Flynn\u2019s case and had asked the president not to pardon his former national security adviser.\nAfter the hearing, Powell said that Flynn \u201cis entitled to a public exoneration by the court. If the system works right, the wrongful prosecution will be dismissed with prejudice. No pardon should be needed. General Flynn is innocent.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s pardon shortcuts Sullivan\u2019s ongoing review. The Justice Department will no longer be able to pursue charges against Flynn for lying to the FBI, even after President-elect Joe Biden and his new attorney general take over next year.\nAn intelligence expert who served as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn, 61, was a prominent adviser to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016, famously leading crowds in chanting \u201clock her up\u201d regarding Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\nAfter Trump was elected, he designated Flynn to serve as his national security adviser. In that role, Flynn conducted a series of meetings and phone calls with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump took office.\nAmong the topics the two discussed were new sanctions that were imposed on Russia by President Barack Obama on Dec. 29, 2016, in response to Russia\u2019s interference in the election. Declassified transcripts of the call show that Flynn and Kislyak spoke that day, and Flynn asked that Russia not respond aggressively to Obama\u2019s move or escalate the conflict.\nThe next day, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he would take no action in reaction to the new sanctions, flummoxing officials in Washington.\nThe reason for the move, however, was made clear in a phone call from Kislyak to Flynn on Dec. 31, in which the Russian envoy told Flynn his views had been \u201ctaken into account\u201d at the Kremlin and were the reason for the muted Russian reaction.\nWhen Flynn was asked 24 days later by two FBI agents whether he discussed the sanctions with Kislyak, he told the agents that he did not remember doing so. In pleading guilty, he told the court he knew this was not true.\nMore recently, he told the court he had not intended to lie.\nAfter a Washington Post columnist reported in January 2017 that Flynn had spoken to Kislyak on the day the sanctions were announced, Vice President Pence and other officials publicly said they had been assured by Flynn that he had not discussed the topic with the Russian ambassador.\nJustice Department officials warned the White House that Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI. After that, Flynn acknowledged privately to Trump that he may have discussed sanctions with Kislyak.\nTrump\u2019s top aides concluded they did not think Flynn could have forgotten the conversation and concluded he had lied. Flynn was then forced to resign from his post.\nSpencer S. Hsu contributed to this report.",

He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful.

The White House seized on that narrative as proof that Trump was the victim of a \u201dhoax\u201d investigation.\n\u201dIf the top leaders of the FBI can target a three-star general with three decades of service, they can target you,\u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said this year.\nDespite Flynn's guilty pleas, the Justice Department moved in May to dismiss the criminal charges, a move Democrats alleged that Attorney General William Barr was making to appease the president. The request was put on hold while the federal judge presiding over Flynn's case reviewed the request.\nA Justice Department official said that Trump's action was \u201dan appropriate use of the president's pardon power\u201d but that the agency wasn't consulted about the move. \u201dWe were given a head's up today,\u201d the official said.\nThe official said they would have \u201dpreferred\u201d for \u201dthe matter to be resolved in court.\u201d\n\u201dWe were confident in the likelihood of our success in the case,\u201d the official said.\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said the pardon was \u201dundeserved, unprincipled, and one more stain on President Trump's rapidly diminishing legacy.\u201d\n\u201dPresident Trump dangled this pardon to encourage Flynn to backtrack on his pledge to cooperate with federal investigators \u2014 cooperation that might have exposed the President's own wrongdoing. And it worked,\u201d Nadler said in a statement.\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said, \u201dIt's no surprise that Trump would go out just as he came in \u2014 crooked to the end.\u201d\nFlynn's case had been championed by Trump's defenders, who decried Mueller's tactics and portrayed Flynn as having been railroaded by the FBI and the \u201ddeep state.\u201d\nHouse Judiciary Republicans said in a tweet that the \u201dpardon is well deserved, principled, and one of President Trump's best decisions.\u201d\n\u201dEvery American, including @RepJerryNadler, should be enraged by what James Comey's FBI did to General Flynn.

Thank you, Mr. President!\u201d\nFlynn's family also issued a statement, thanking Trump \u201dfor answering our prayers and the prayers of a nation by removing the heavy burden of injustice off the shoulders of our brother Michael, with a full pardon of innocence.\u201d\nFlynn, 61, was a top campaign surrogate for Trump in 2016, and he led chants of \u201dlock her up\u201d about Trump's 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, in a speech at the Republican National Convention that year.\nTrump named Flynn as his national security adviser after winning the election, even though he had been warned in a meeting by President Barack Obama that Flynn wasn't suited to the job, NBC News reported in 2017. Obama had fired Flynn as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014.\nFlynn didn't last long as Trump's national security adviser \u2014 he resigned after less than four weeks into the job after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President-elect Mike Pence and other administration officials about conversations he'd had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\nIn one of the calls, Flynn asked Kislyak \u2014 whose communications were being monitored \u2014 whether Russia would hold off on retaliatory sanctions against the U.S. because Trump would reverse the Obama administration's sanctions punishing Russia for election meddling.\nFlynn denied that he had done so to Pence, who repeated Flynn's denial publicly. That led FBI Director James Comey to send agents to interview Flynn. Flynn lied to those agents, as well \u2014 a federal crime that Mueller's team used to get a guilty plea from Flynn.\nAfter Flynn's initial plea, Trump tweeted, \u201dI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI.\u201d\n\u201dHe has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!\u201d Trump added.\nTrump adviser Hope Hicks told Mueller's investigators that Trump thought Flynn had \u201dbad judgment.\u201d\nTrump's opinion of Flynn appeared to change after Flynn stopped cooperating with Mueller's team, switched lawyers and complained that he had been \u201dduped\u201d into pleading guilty by investigators seeking to nail Trump.\n\u201dHe is a great gentleman,\u201d Trump said this year.\nThe Justice Department also softened its stance, with Barr ordering a U.S. attorney to review the case and with Justice Department officials intervening in January to change the government's sentencing recommendation for Flynn from six months in jail to probation.\nIn May, the U.S. attorney whom Barr appointed to review the case found that Flynn shouldn't have been questioned by the FBI in the first place and recommended that the charges be dropped.\nBarr \u2014 who has repeatedly criticized the Mueller investigation \u2014 agreed.\n\u201dA crime cannot be established here,\u201d Barr told CBS News, adding that \u201dpeople sometimes plead to things that turn out not be crimes.\u201d\nAsked whether he was doing Trump's bidding, Barr said, \u201dI'm doing the law's bidding.\u201d\nIn another twist, Flynn's lawyer Sidney Powell \u2014 who recently was working with the Trump campaign in its efforts to overturn the election results \u2014 acknowledged that she had had a direct conversation with Trump about Flynn's case.\n\u201dI provided the White House an update on the status of the litigation,\u201d she said in court in September. \u201dAnd I asked that the president not issue a pardon.\u201d",

Russia denied meddling.\nIn May, Attorney General William Barr stunned many in the legal community by ordering prosecutors to have the case dropped, a decision that came after Trump repeatedly complained that Flynn was being treated unfairly.\nFlynn and the Trump administration said U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who presided over the case, was required by law to grant the request for dismissal.

But he later switched lawyers and tactics, arguing that prosecutors in the case had tricked him into lying about his December 2016 conversations with Kislyak.\nThe Justice Department has repeatedly denied allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, and Sullivan rejected all of Flynn\u2019s claims in December 2019.\nFederal prosecutors had asked the judge in January to sentence Flynn to up to six months in prison, arguing in a court filing that \u201dthe defendant has not learned his lesson. He has behaved as though the law does not apply to him, and as if there are no consequences for his actions.\u201d\nFlynn also served as head of the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency but was forced out in 2014 in part due to his management style and opinions on how to fight Islamist militancy.\nHe joined the Trump 2016 election campaign and at the Republican National Convention that year led supporters in chants of \u201dLock her up,\u201d in reference to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\nOther former Trump aides were convicted of federal crimes following the Russia inquiry. Trump's longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone was sentenced on Feb. 20 to three years and four months in prison for obstruction of justice, witness tampering and lying to lawmakers investigating the Russian election interference. Trump commuted his sentence.\nPaul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, was sentenced last year to 3-1/2 years in prison after being convicted of unlawful lobbying and witness tampering, which combined with a sentence in a related case equaled a term of more than seven years behind bars.

Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 25, 2020\nTrump is considering a raft of pardons before he\u2019s booted out in January, and hopeful recipients are going to crazy lengths to lobby for one, according to a New York Times report.\nThe retired Army lieutenant general had served as Trump\u2019s national security adviser for less than a month before things started to go downhill. His tenure was fraught from the very beginning: Shortly before leaving office, President Barack Obama reportedly warned Trump, then president-elect, against hiring Flynn. Then, weeks before the inauguration, Flynn reportedly told Trump\u2019s transition team that he was under federal investigation for secretly working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey.\nBut it was Flynn\u2019s contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak\u2014in which he discussed new sanctions imposed by the Obama administration, among other things\u2014 that landed Flynn in legal jeopardy. He pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Kislyak as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation in 2017.\nAfter initially cooperating with Mueller, Flynn fired his lawyers and reversed course. In summer 2019, Flynn began trying to rescind his guilty plea, claiming he\u2019d been the victim of \u201cDeep State\u201d prosecutors who were out to set him up\u2014a martyrdom narrative that Trump has long amplified. It has made Flynn a hero to the MAGA revenge fantasy known as QAnon, which Flynn, like his now-disgraced attorney Sidney Powell, has appeared to embrace.\nAnd in a move that intensified concerns about Trump using the Justice Department for his own personal vendettas, Attorney General William Barr in May moved to drop the charges against Flynn, arguing that he was really just a victim of FBI overreach. The case had been working its way through federal court after Judge Emmet Sullivan, the same judge who told Flynn ahead of sentencing that he \u201csold out\u201d his country, challenged DOJ\u2019s bid to dismiss charges.\nTrump has claimed to have had nothing to do with the Justice Department\u2019s move to drop charges but has heaped praise on Flynn, calling him an \u201cinnocent man\u201d and a \u201cwarrior.\u201d\nTrump had also repeatedly teased the idea of pardoning his former national security adviser, boasting in late April that he had a \u201cdifferent type of power\u201d to use if Flynn were not cleared in court.\n\u201cIt looks to me like Michael Flynn would be exonerated based on everything I see,\u201d he told reporters at that time.\nThe move comes as more and more within Trump\u2019s orbit appear to have come to terms with the fact that he won\u2019t have a second term, even as the president himself refuses to concede.\nIt is not unusual for presidents to issue pardons at the end of their terms, but Trump has worried some legal experts with his apparent willingness to grant pardons to his allies and those his most ardent followers embrace.\nTrump has granted pardons to former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of criminal contempt of court for defying a judge\u2019s order to stop racial profiling, and right-wing provocateur Dinesh D'Souza, who had pleaded guilty to campaign finance law violations. He commuted the sentence of Roger Stone, his longtime confidant who was convicted of witness tampering and lying to Congress during the Russia investigation. Following a campaign from some of his favorite Fox News personalities,, Trump has granted clemency to U.S. service members accused or convicted of war crimes.\nFlynn provided an incalculable service to Trump at a time when his first presidential campaign needed it most. As the intelligence chief of the Joint Special Operations Command, and later the Afghanistan war, Flynn fought the war on terror like very few others. United with Trump over their mutual contempt for Islam, which Flynn has called a \u201cmalignant cancer,\u201d Flynn gave Trump\u2019s campaign military validation at a time when dozens of senior military and intelligence veterans said Trump was unfit to be president.\nFlynn came into Trump\u2019s orbit after their mutual adversary, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, fired Flynn from his position atop the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. By appointing Flynn national security adviser, and now by pardoning him, Trump has now twice saved Flynn from disgrace.\nWith additional reporting by Spencer Ackerman\nRead more at The Daily Beast.",
            "\u00a9 Provided by Washington Examiner\nPresident Trump announced a pardon for retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn on Wednesday, seemingly bringing to an end a legal saga that began during the 2016 election amid the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane investigation.\n\u201dIt is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!\u201d Trump said in a tweet.\nIt is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 25, 2020\nFlynn, 61, fought to dismiss the government's case against him this year after he pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to investigators about his December 2016 conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak related to Russia\u2019s response to the Obama administration kicking Russians out of the United States as retaliation for Russian election interference and related to a U.N. resolution on Israel. The U.S. government intercepted Flynn's discussions with Kislyak, after which fired FBI special agent Peter Strzok and FBI agent Joseph Pientka grilled him on the contents of the conversation on Jan. 24, 2017.\nFlynn told the court in January that he was \u201cinnocent of this crime.\u201d He filed to withdraw his guilty plea after the Justice Department asked the judge to sentence him to up to six months in prison \u2014 though afterward, the department said probation would also be appropriate. The Justice Department later moved to drop the charges in May, following a deep-dive review by U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri Jeffrey Jensen. The DOJ said that \u201ccontinued prosecution of this case would not serve the interests of justice.\u201d\nInstead, presiding Judge Emmet Sullivan, an appointee of President Bill Clinton who has handled the Flynn case since December 2017, appointed retired New York Judge John Gleeson to present arguments in opposition to the Justice Department\u2019s motion and to explore whether Flynn should be charged with perjury or contempt.\nThe full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed a three-judge appeals court panel decision in late August and denied Flynn\u2019s effort to have the case against him swiftly dropped. The decision threw the case back to Sullivan, but the appeals court did tell the judge that \u201cas the underlying criminal case resumes, in the District Court, we trust and expect the District Court to proceed with appropriate dispatch.\u201d Sullivan had yet refused to dismiss it.\nFlynn\u2019s lawyers, led by Sidney Powell since last summer, argued in October that Sullivan\u2019s \u201cincreasingly hostile and unprecedented words and deeds in what has become his own prosecution of General Flynn mandate his disqualification.\u201d Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall said in August that the Justice Department \u201creluctantly\u201d believed that Sullivan might need to be removed because he seemed to have \u201cprejudged\u201d some of the questions in the case. During a September hearing, Powell said she had spoken with Trump to give him an \u201cupdate\u201d on her client's case and claimed the only request she made was that he \u201cnot issue a pardon\u201d to Flynn.\nTrump\u2019s legal team recently attempted to distance itself from Powell\u2019s claims of voting machine fraud.\nThe upper echelons of the Obama administration learned of the calls between Flynn and Kislyak, and David Ignatius wrote in the Washington Post on Jan. 12, 2017 revealing the existence of classified details from those calls, claiming that Flynn \u201ccultivates close Russian contacts,\u201d citing a \u201csenior U.S. government official\u201d who revealed when Flynn talked to Kislyak. U.S. Attorney John Durham is reportedly looking into that Flynn leak, among a host of issues related to the origins and conduct of the Trump-Russia investigation.\nThe Trump national security adviser resigned on Feb. 14, 2017 for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his discussions with Kislyak.\nFlynn agreed to cooperate with Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation. The defense team that negotiated the plea deal was fired, though, and since taking over last summer, Powell has argued that \u201cthere never would\u2019ve been a plea to begin with\u201d if Flynn knew how much information the Justice Department was hiding from him.\nFired FBI Director James Comey admitted he took advantage of the chaos in the early days of Trump's administration when he sent FBI agents over to the White House to talk to Flynn. Records released earlier this year included handwritten notes from Hurricane leader Bill Priestap on the day the FBI interviewed Flynn, showing doubts about the strategy being pursued, writing, \u201cWhat is our goal? Truth/Admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?\u201d\nHandwritten notes by Strzok seem to quote President-elect Joe Biden raising the \u201cLogan Act\u201d related to Flynn during an Oval Office meeting on Jan. 5, 2017, according to an apparent conversation Strzok had with Comey afterward. Strzok wrote that Comey said the calls between Flynn and Kislyak \u201dappear legit.\u201d Former President Barack Obama emphasized that \u201cthe right people\u201d should look into Flynn.\nFormer Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said she couldn\u2019t remember if Biden had brought up the Logan Act, and Comey testified it didn\u2019t happen.\nIn interviews this year, Biden contradicted himself on what he knew about the Flynn investigation.\nA declassified National Security Agency list of officials who received information in response to \u201cunmasking\u201d requests related to Flynn between Election Day 2016 and the end of January 2017 shows Biden was one recipient.\nA draft communication closing the Flynn case dated Jan. 4, 2017, showed the bureau had turned up \u201cno derogatory information\u201d on Flynn. But the same day, texts from Strzok reveal he intervened to keep it open at the insistence of the FBI\u2019s \u201c7th floor\u201d leadership after the bureau obtained intercepts of conversations between Flynn and Kislyak, and that Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page discussed the Logan Act.\nInternal text messages sent by FBI analysts working on the case against the retired Flynn in 2016 and 2017 reveal doubt inside the investigation into Flynn. William Barnett, one of the lead FBI agents involved with the inquiry into Flynn, believed the Flynn case should\u2019ve been closed, and he jokingly referred to the Trump-Russia investigation as \u201cCollusion Clue\u201d and argued that many investigators, including some on Mueller\u2019s team, were out to \u201cget Trump.\u201d\nDeclassified FBI documents also show the counterintelligence briefing the bureau gave to Trump and his national security team during the 2016 campaign was used as a way to gather investigative evidence on the Trump campaign and Flynn. DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz previously testified that this briefing was a \u201cpretext\u201d to help their counterintelligence investigation, a move signed off on by fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and former FBI General Counsel James Baker.\nMueller\u2019s 448-page report, released in April 2019, said the Russians interfered in 2016 in a \u201csweeping and systematic fashion\u201d but \u201ddid not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government.\u201d\nHorowitz\u2019s lengthy 2019 report criticized the Justice Department and the FBI for at least 17 \u201csignificant errors and omissions\u201d related to the FISA warrants against Trump campaign associate Carter Page and for the bureau's reliance on British ex-spy Christopher Steele\u2019s discredited and Democrat-funded dossier. Declassified footnotes showed that the FBI was aware that Steele\u2019s dossier might have been compromised by Russian disinformation.\nTags: News, Mike Flynn, Donald Trump, Joe Biden, 2016 Elections, Pardons, Justice Department, Sidney Powell\nOriginal Author: Jerry Dunleavy\nOriginal Location: Trump pardons Michael Flynn",

            "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump announced Wednesday evening that he had issued a full pardon to Gen. Michael Flynn, a former member of his 2016 presidential campaign and a national security adviser in his administration. Flynn had faced charges stemming from false statements he made to the FBI about his contacts with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States.\n\u201cIt is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter, adding, \u201cCongratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!\u201d\nFlynn, who was Trump\u2019s first White House national security adviser, became the second former member of his campaign team to receive a pardon or commutation. In July, Trump commuted the sentence of his longtime adviser Roger Stone, who was found guilty of multiple charges including witness tampering, obstruction and lying to investigators.\nTrump\u2019s decision to pardon Flynn will almost certainly add to mounting speculation that he will pardon other allies who are in legal jeopardy. Multiple members of his campaign team and inner circle have faced criminal charges since he took office, including two men who helped lead his 2016 presidential campaign, Steve Bannon and Paul Manafort. Flynn and other Trump associates under legal scrutiny have attained star status from the president\u2019s supporters.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment about the decision to pardon Flynn.\n\u00a9 Provided by Yahoo! News Michael Flynn, President Trump's former national security adviser. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\nIn late 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty for lying to the FBI about his contacts with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn had been fired from the White House earlier that year after it was found he also lied to Vice President Mike Pence about contact with Kislyak. Following his guilty plea, Flynn began cooperating with former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mueller later claimed Flynn had admitted to misrepresenting lobbying work he did on behalf of the Turkish government, though Flynn was not charged in that matter.\nPrior to joining forces with Trump, Flynn had a long military career that included a stint as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under Trump\u2019s predecessor, President Barack Obama. He was forced out in 2014 amid reports of disagreements with colleagues. Flynn eventually became one of Trump\u2019s more prominent surrogates on the campaign trail during the 2016 presidential campaign, emphasizing his military experience and ties to the Democratic administration.\nSince last year, Flynn\u2019s attorneys have sought to have his guilty plea reversed and the charges against him dismissed, alleging federal misconduct. Federal prosecutors under Attorney General William Barr also filed a motion to dismiss the charges against Flynn, but U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan has been fighting the dismissal.\nFlynn\u2019s attorney, Sidney Powell, worked on Trump\u2019s efforts to challenge his defeat in this month\u2019s presidential election before being abruptly disavowed by other members of the president\u2019s legal team on Nov. 22. Powell has said she told Trump \u201cnot to issue a pardon\u201d to Flynn and instead to allow the efforts to have his case dismissed continue. Powell did not respond to a request for comment on this story.\nFlynn posted a message on his Twitter page Wednesday afternoon shortly before the news of the pardon broke. His message included an American flag emoji and pointed to a Bible verse that says, \u201c\u2018They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you and will rescue you,\u2019 declares the Lord.\u201d\n_____\nRead more from Yahoo News:",

He eventually pleaded guilty to perjury charges over that lie and also cooperated in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s Trump-boosting attack on the 2016 election.\nBut Flynn had a curious change of heart this year and asked to withdraw his guilty plea.\nIn a move that pleased Trump, Attorney General William Barr\u2019s Justice Department then sought to drop the case against Flynn altogether \u2014 even though the ex-national security adviser had already pleaded guilty twice.\nU.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan refused the Justice Department\u2019s unusual request and appointed an outside expert to argue against tossing the Flynn case.

That being said, this is obviously an appropriate use of the president's pardon power.\u201d\nLed by former Trump election lawyer Powell, Flynn's defense team repeatedly cast her client's prosecution as a politically motivated conspiracy among Obama administration officials and accused prosecutors of hiding evidence that would have exonerated her client.\nAttorney General William Barr argued that an FBI interview during which Flynn made false statements was \u201dunjustified,\u201d drawing widespread criticism and protests from the Flynn prosecution team.\nIn his challenge to the Justice action, Sullivan appointed a third party, known as an amicus, who examined whether Flynn committed perjury by claiming to be innocent of a crime to which he had pleaded guilty.\nRetired federal judge John Gleeson, Sullivan's appointed amicus, accused the Justice Department of \u201dgross abuse of prosecutorial power\u201d by pushing to drop the case against Flynn. Gleeson said the government's motion to dismiss should be denied because its arguments \u201dare not credible,\u201d suggesting prosecutors violated safeguards to prevent \u201ddubious dismissals of criminal cases that would benefit powerful and well-connected defendants.\u201d\n'Abuse of prosecutorial power':Retired federal judge slams Justice Department in Flynn case\nGleeson's appointment took the case to unprecedented heights. Flynn's defense team took the fight to the federal appeals court in Washington to force Sullivan to dismiss the case. It pitted one branch of government against the other, raising questions about whether a judge can override prosecutors' decisions to drop a criminal case.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled in August that the case should not be immediately dismissed and that Sullivan had the authority to appoint a third party to challenge the Justice Department. Sullivan's attorney argued that he was simply doing what judges do: seeking to hear both sides before ruling on the motion to dismiss.\nThe Flynn saga:Appeals court denies ex-Trump adviser Michael Flynn's request to force dismissal of case\nThe ruling reversed a decision by a three-judge panel from the appeals court, which found Sullivan's actions to be \u201dunprecedented intrusions of individual liberty\u201d and on the Justice Department's prosecutorial powers. The appeals court's ruling sent the case back to Sullivan.\nIn early October, Powell sought Sullivan's recusal from the case, arguing that he had been \u201dincreasingly hostile\u201d and \u201dirreparably biased\u201d against the former Army general. The appeals court had rejected such an argument in its ruling in August, saying opinions or statements judges make while presiding over a case don't indicate bias.\nContributing: John Fritze and Nicholas Wu",
            "Trump\u2019s move marks a full embrace of the retired general he had ousted from the White House after only 22 days on the job \u2014 and a final salvo against the Russia investigation that shadowed the first half of his term in office.\nThe pardon he granted Flynn, an early backer of his 2016 White House bid, underlines how Trump has used his clemency power to benefit allies and well-connected offenders. White House officials said Trump has been considering other pardons before leaving office, including possibly other former aides who were convicted of crimes as part of the special counsel probe of Russian interference in the 2016 campaign.\nAD\nAD\nFlynn pleaded guilty to a felony in December 2017, admitting that he had misled investigators about details of his conversations with the Russian ambassador during Trump\u2019s presidential transition.\nHis plea was one of the first major courtroom victories for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who had been appointed seven months earlier.\nThe special counsel probe ultimately did not establish the Trump campaign had entered into a criminal conspiracy with the Kremlin. But the investigation documented how Russia interfered in the 2016 race to benefit Trump, and how Trump\u2019s campaign welcomed the assistance.\nFlynn was one of six Trump associates to be convicted or charged with crimes before the probe ended in 2019. The president and his allies have repeatedly attacked Flynn\u2019s prosecution as overzealous and flawed in their efforts to discredit the special counsel inquiry.\nAD\nAD\nThis spring, Barr and the Justice Department suddenly reversed course, declaring that prosecutors should not have brought the case against Flynn and seeking to have it dismissed. That request has been pending before a federal judge, who has been reviewing the case.\nOn Wednesday, Trump tweeted, \u201cIt is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!\u201d\nNot long before Trump announced the pardon publicly, Flynn tweeted an image of the American flag and the words \u201cJeremiah 1:19,\u201d a reference to a Bible verse in which God says, \u201cThey will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you and will rescue you.\u201d\nAD\nDemocrats responded to the long-anticipated pardon with outrage. In a lengthy statement, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Flynn had chosen \u201cloyalty to Trump over loyalty to his country\u201d and that Trump\u2019s decision was intended to insulate himself from criminal investigation. He called the move a \u201ccorruption\u201d of what the framers intended in giving the president broad pardon powers.\nAD\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that Trump would go out just as he came in \u2014 crooked to the end,\u201d Schiff said.\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) called the pardon \u201cundeserved, unprincipled, and one more stain on President Trump\u2019s rapidly diminishing legacy.\u201d\nAD\nThrough a representative, Mueller declined to comment.\nBut Andrew Weissmann, a former member of the special counsel team, tweeted, \u201cTrump\u2019s abuse of the pardon power undermines the crown jewel of our democracy: the rule of law.\u201d\nTrump told one adviser this week that Flynn had considerable support from the conservative community, and that his pardon would be well received among his supporters, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private conversation.\nFlynn had also developed close ties with Jenna Ellis, one of the president\u2019s legal advisers, who is pushing his false allegations of fraud in this month\u2019s election.\nAD\nAD\nLast week, the night before she appeared at a news conference at the headquarters of the Republican National Committee in Washington to discuss the president\u2019s claims about the election, Ellis posted a photograph on Twitter of herself with Flynn and the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. She has discussed Flynn\u2019s case with Trump, according to the person.\nChief of Staff Mark Meadows was an advocate for the Flynn pardon, and has often commiserated with the president about how unfair the Mueller investigation was to Flynn and others.\nFlynn is the second Trump associate caught up in the Mueller probe to benefit from the president\u2019s power to grant clemency. In July, Trump commuted the sentence of his former adviser, Roger Stone, who had been convicted of lying to Congress about his efforts to secure information from WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign.\nAD\nAD\nTrump has largely eschewed the traditional pardon process, in which people convicted of crimes formally apply for White House consideration and have their applications reviewed by Justice Department lawyers.\nInstead, the president has taken recommendations from friends, TV hosts and White House advisers, such as son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has taken a large role in some of the past decisions.\nIt is unclear whether Trump might seek to preemptively pardon himself or any of his family members, who have told others they expect to face ongoing investigations after Trump leaves office.\nAfter his guilty plea in late 2017, Flynn initially cooperated with special counsel prosecutors pursuing other cases, delaying his sentencing.\nAD\nBut once Mueller\u2019s team disbanded, Flynn hired new lawyers \u2014 including attorney Sidney Powell, who this fall has been part of a team of Trump legal advisers working to overturn the November election results by promoting baseless conspiracy theories about fraud.\nAD\nIn the Flynn case, Powell argued that Flynn had been entrapped during his FBI interview, conducted at the White House four days after Trump took office. She maintained that he had never intended to lie and that key documents had been withheld from him by prosecutors.\nProsecutors at first continued to pursue the case, and a federal judge rejected several of Flynn\u2019s new arguments.\nBut in May, acting on instructions from Barr, the Justice Department reversed course and said a new review of the case\u2019s origins led prosecutors to conclude that Flynn\u2019s lies could not be proved in court. Because of that, the department said, they were not material to an FBI investigation of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election that was underway at the time.\nThe stunning turnaround prompted fears of politicization at the Justice Department. Barr insisted that a review of the case concluded it should be dismissed.\nAD\nAD\nRather than immediately accept that, however, U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, who has overseen the case, signaled that he wished to explore whether the Justice Department had acted properly and whether Flynn was being given special treatment because he is an ally of the president.\nFlynn objected to Sullivan\u2019s handling of the case, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled the judge did not have to immediately grant the Justice Department\u2019s request to drop the matter.\nIn September, Powell told Sullivan that she had personally briefed Trump on Flynn\u2019s case and had asked the president not to pardon his former national security adviser.\nBut on Wednesday, Powell said the pardon was appropriate. \u201cIt was high time that he be exonerated of all these charges,\u201d she said on Fox Business. \u201cIt was truly a pardon of innocence.\u201d\nAD\nTrump\u2019s pardon shortcuts Sullivan\u2019s ongoing review. The Justice Department will no longer be able to pursue charges against Flynn for lying to the FBI, even after President-elect Joe Biden and his new attorney general take over next year.\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that accepting a pardon is akin to an admission of guilt \u2014 though some presidents and governors have used their pardon powers to help people who maintained their innocence.\nA Justice Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the department was not consulted in advance of the pardon but was given a \u201cheads-up\u201d on Wednesday. The official said the department would have preferred to see if Sullivan would act, and for the matter to be resolved in court.\n\u201cWe were confident in the likelihood of our success in the case,\u201d the official said. They said, however, the move was \u201cobviously an appropriate use of the president\u2019s pardon power.\u201d\nFlynn, now 61, was a highly regarded military intelligence officer who served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan before being named director of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama.\nBut he was pushed out of that job amid concerns about his leadership skills, and a penchant for taking positions on matters related to Iran and militant Islam not supported by underlying intelligence. Associates of Flynn said he was so embittered by his treatment that he turned against Obama, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and others he blamed for his professional demise.\nIn 2016, he lent Trump\u2019s campaign legitimacy at a time when no other established national security official role was willing to endorse the former reality TV star or advise him on foreign policy issues.\nAs a campaign adviser, he led crowds in chants of \u201clock her up!\u201d about Clinton and, in recent years, as his legal woes mounted, Flynn has made statements and postings on Twitter that suggest he has embraced online conspiracy claims espoused by QAnon and other sources.\nAfter Trump was elected, he designated Flynn to serve as his national security adviser. In that role, Flynn conducted a series of meetings and phone calls with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump was inaugurated.\nAmong the topics the two discussed were new sanctions that were imposed on Russia by Obama on Dec. 29, 2016, in response to Russia\u2019s interference in the election. Declassified transcripts of the call show that Flynn and Kislyak spoke that day, and Flynn asked that Russia not respond aggressively to Obama\u2019s move or escalate the conflict.\nThe next day, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he would take no action in reaction to the new sanctions, flummoxing officials in Washington.\nThe reason for the move, however, was made clear in a phone call from Kislyak to Flynn on Dec. 31, in which the Russian envoy told Flynn his views had been \u201ctaken into account\u201d at the Kremlin and were the reason for the muted Russian reaction.\nWhen Flynn was asked 24 days later by two FBI agents whether he discussed the sanctions with Kislyak, he told the agents that he did not remember doing so. In pleading guilty, he told the court he knew this was not true.\nMore recently, he told the court he had not intended to lie.\nAfter a Washington Post columnist reported in January 2017 that Flynn had spoken to Kislyak on the day the sanctions were announced, Vice President Pence and other officials publicly said they had been assured by Flynn that he had not discussed the topic with the Russian ambassador.\nJustice Department officials warned the White House that Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI. After that, Flynn acknowledged privately to Trump that he might have discussed sanctions with Kislyak.\nTrump\u2019s top aides concluded they did not think Flynn could have forgotten the conversation and concluded he had lied. Flynn was then forced to resign from his post.\nWhy Flynn chose to lie repeatedly about his contacts with Kislyak is one of the lingering mysteries of the Russia investigation. Many legal experts believe that if had he been truthful, he probably would not have faced charges or lost his job.\nIn pleading guilty, Flynn also told the court that he had acted as a foreign agent of the government of Turkey while working as a consultant during the 2016 presidential campaign \u2014 and falsely filed paperwork with the Justice Department in March 2017 indicating that he had not known whether Turkey would benefit from the work or not. Flynn later denied knowingly making false statements about his Turkey work.\nHis lies to the FBI \u2014 as well as his undisclosed work for Turkey \u2014 prompted Sullivan to lecture the retired general at a dramatic hearing not long after he pleaded guilty, telling him that his crime was a \u201cvery serious offense.\u201d\nThe judge pointed to the American flag that sat on the bench next to him and told the retired military officer: \u201cArguably, you sold your country out.\u201d",

Obama had fired Flynn as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014.\nFlynn didn't last long as Trump's national security adviser \u2014 he resigned after less than four weeks into the job after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President-elect Mike Pence and other administration officials about conversations he'd had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\nIn one of the calls, Flynn asked Kislyak \u2014 whose communications were being monitored \u2014 whether Russia would hold off on retaliatory sanctions against the U.S. because Trump would reverse the Obama administration's sanctions punishing Russia for election meddling.\nFlynn denied that he had done so to Pence, who repeated Flynn's denial publicly. That led FBI Director James Comey to send agents to interview Flynn. Flynn lied to those agents, as well \u2014 a federal crime that Mueller's team used to get a guilty plea from Flynn.\nAfter Flynn's initial plea, Trump tweeted, \u201dI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI.\u201d\n\u201dHe has pled guilty to those lies.

In fact, the Department of Justice has firmly concluded that the charges against General Flynn should be dropped.\u201d\nThe Flynn family issued a lengthy statement celebrating the decision: \u201dToday, the Flynn family is grateful to President Donald J. Trump for answering our prayers and the prayers of a nation by removing the heavy burden of injustice off the shoulders of our brother, Michael, with a full pardon of innocence. We thank President Trump for recognizing our brother's sacrifice in this battle for truth, our Constitution, our republic, and all that America stands for around the world \u2014 a true beacon of liberty.\u201d\nThe president has repeatedly defended Flynn as an \u201dinnocent man\u201d who was unfairly targeted by rogue FBI officials during their investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, which the president has long derided as a \u201dhoax\u201d that was designed to undermine his presidency.\nAn early supporter of Mr. Trump's bid for the White House in 2016, Flynn would go on to serve less than a month as his national security adviser before he was fired in February 2017 for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about contacts with Sergey Kislyak, who was then Russian ambassador to the U.S.\nIn the years since, Flynn has been at the center of a legal battle winding its way through the justice system. He admitted guilt in December 2017 \u2014and agreed to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller, who took over the Russia probe \u2014 and then again in December 2018 to making false statements to federal investigators about his contacts with Kislyak. But in January, Flynn asked to withdraw his guilty plea.\nIn a filing with the federal district court in Washington, Flynn's lawyers wrote that he was seeking to withdraw his plea because of the \u201dgovernment's bad faith, vindictiveness and breach of the plea agreement.\u201d\nThen, in May, the Justice Department sought to dismiss its case against Flynn, kicking off an ongoing fight with U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who is presiding over the case. In their filing, federal prosecutors said the FBI's January 2017 interview with Flynn was \u201duntethered to, and unjustified by\u201d its counterintelligence investigation. The bureau, the Justice Department said, offered \u201dfrail and shifting justifications\u201d for its ongoing investigation of Flynn.\nBut Sullivan declined to immediately dismiss Flynn's case and instead appointed a retired federal judge as a \u201dfriend of the court\u201d to argue against the Justice Department. In response to Sullivan's move, Flynn asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to force the lower court judge to dismiss the case.\nIn June, a divided three-judge panel on the D.C. Circuit ruled in Flynn's favor and ordered Sullivan to drop the criminal case against him, but Sullivan asked the full court to rehear the dispute. In August, the full D.C. Circuit denied Flynn's request in an 8-2 ruling and sent the case back to the lower court to allow Sullivan to examine the Justice Department's request to toss out the case against Flynn.\nSullivan has not yet ruled on the Justice Department's motion to drop the charges.\nThe president's decision to pardon his former national security adviser was anticipated, as Mr. Trump has claimed Flynn is \u201dbeing persecuted\u201d and celebrated the Justice Department's efforts to dismiss the case against him. In March, the president said he was \u201dstrongly considering\u201d pardoning Flynn.\nStill, despite Mr. Trump's public comments, Sidney Powell, Flynn's attorney, explained in a September court hearing she asked the president not to pardon Flynn and provided him an update on the litigation.\nMr. Trump said last week Powell was joining his team of lawyers contesting the results of the presidential election, and she appeared alongside Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, and other Trump campaign advisers during a press conference at the Republican National Committee. But in an abrupt about-face, Giuliani and Trump campaign senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis said Sunday that Powell is \u201dnot a member of the Trump legal team\u201d and is also \u201dnot a lawyer for the president in his personal capacity.\u201d\nThe president's action was met with swift condemnation from congressional Democrats, who accused Mr. Trump of abusing his pardon power to benefit his friends and political allies.\n\u201dThere is no doubt that a president has broad power to confer pardons, but when they are deployed to insulate himself, his family, and his associates from criminal investigation, it is a corruption of the Framer's intent,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, said in a statement.\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York said the pardon is \u201dundeserved, unprincipled, and one more stain on President Trump's rapidly diminishing legacy.\u201d\nMr. Trump's pardon of Flynn is likely to be the first of several granted in the final weeks of his presidency, as outgoing presidents tend to issue grants of clemency before leaving office. It is also not the only reprieve the president has extended to close aides ensnared in Mueller's probe.\nIn July, Mr. Trump commuted the prison sentence of Republican political operative and informal adviser Roger Stone days before he was set to report to prison. Stone was convicted of seven federal charges in November 2019 and sentenced to 40 months behind bars in February.",

Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., offered similar criticism.\n\u201dThis pardon is undeserved, unprincipled, and one more stain on President Trump\u2019s rapidly diminishing legacy,\u201d the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said in a statement.\n\u201dThis pardon is part of a pattern,\u201d he continued. \u201dWe saw it before, in the Roger Stone case -- where President Trump granted clemency to protect an individual who might have implicated the President in criminal misconduct. We may see it again before President Trump finally leaves office. These actions are an abuse of power and fundamentally undermine the rule of law.\u201d\nFlynn, a key adviser on Trump's 2016 campaign, was named the president's first national security adviser on Nov. 18, 2016. He was sworn in two days after Trump's inauguration.\nJust four days after his swearing in, the Department of Justice's then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates informed White House counsel Don McGahn that they were misled and expressed concerns that Russia might try to blackmail Flynn. ABC News confirmed through a source close to Yates that the U.S. captured a phone call between Flynn and Kislyak discussing sanctions leveled by then-President Barack Obama in late 2016.\nFlynn resigned on Feb. 13, after less than a month in the position, after he admitted in a letter that he misled then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence about the nature of his calls with the Russian ambassador.\n\u201dUnfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador,\u201d Flynn's letter read. \u201dI have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology.\u201d\nABC News' Benjamin Siegel contributed to this report.",
            "President Donald Trump pardoned former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn on Wednesday, taking direct aim at a Russia investigation he has long insisted was motivated by political bias.\nTrump tweeted:\n\u201dIt is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!\u201d\nBefore the pardon, Flynn tweeted a Bible verse, Jeremiah 1:19, which reads:\n\u201d'They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you and will rescue you,' declares the Lord.\u201d\nFlynn is the second Trump associate convicted in the Russia probe to be granted clemency by the president. Trump commuted the sentence of longtime confidant Roger Stone just days before he was to report to prison. It is part of a broader effort to undo the results of an investigation that for years has shadowed his administration and yielded criminal charges against a half dozen associates.\nThe action voids the criminal case against Flynn just as a federal judge was weighing, skeptically, whether to grant a Justice Department request to dismiss the prosecution despite Flynn's own guilty plea to lying to the FBI about his Russia contacts.\nThe move is likely to energize supporters who have taken up the case as a cause celebre and rallied around the retired Army lieutenant general as the victim of what they assert is an unfair prosecution. Trump himself has repeatedly spoken warmly about Flynn, even though special counsel Robert Mueller's prosecutors once praised him as a model cooperator in their probe into ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign.\nThe pardon is the final step in a case defined by twists and turns over the last year after the Justice Department abruptly move to dismiss the case, insisting Flynn should have never been interviewed by the FBI in the first place, only to have U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan refuse the request and appoint a former judge to argue against the federal government's position.\nIn the months since, a three-judge panel's decision ordering Sullivan to dismiss the case was overturned by the full appeals court, which sent the matter back to Sullivan. At a hearing in September, Flynn lawyer Sidney Powell told the judge she had discussed the Flynn case with Trump but also said she did not want a pardon \u2014 presumably because she wanted him to be vindicated in the courts.\nPowell emerged separately in recent weeks as a public face of the Trump's election challenge of Joe Biden, but the Trump legal team ultimately distanced itself from her after she advanced a series of uncorroborated conspiracy claims.\nThe pardon spares Flynn the possibility of any prison sentence, which Sullivan could potentially have imposed had he ultimately decided to reject the Justice Department's dismissal request. That request was made in May after a review of the case by a federal prosecutor from St. Louis who had been specially appointed by Attorney General William Barr.\nFlynn acknowledged lying during the FBI interview by saying he had not discussed with the then-Russian Amb. Sergey Kislyak, sanctions that had just been imposed on Russia for election interference by the outgoing Obama administration. During that conversation, Flynn urged Kislyak for Russia to be \u201deven-keeled\u201d in response to the punitive measures, and assured him \u201dwe can have a better conversation\u201d about relations between the two countries after Trump became president.\nThe conversation alarmed the FBI, which at the time was investigating whether the Trump campaign and Russia had coordinated to sway the election's outcome. In addition, White House officials were stating publicly Flynn and Kislyak had not discussed sanctions.\nBut last May, the Justice Department abruptly reversed its position in the case. It said the FBI had no basis to interview Flynn about Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the United States, and that any statements he may have made were not relevant to the FBI's broader counterintelligence probe. It cited internal FBI notes showing agents had planned to close out their investigation into Flynn weeks earlier.\nFlynn was ousted from his position in February 2017 after news broke he had indeed discussed sanctions with Kislyak, and former Obama administration officials had warned the White House he could be vulnerable to blackmail.\nFlynn was among the first of the president's aides to admit guilt in Mueller's investigation and cooperated extensively for months. He provided such extensive cooperation that prosecutors did not recommend any prison time and suggested they would be fine with probation.\nBut on the morning he was to have been sentenced, after a stern rebuke about his behavior from Sullivan, Flynn asked for the hearing to be cut short so he could continue cooperating and earn credit toward a more lenient sentence.\nAfter that, though, he hired new attorneys \u2014 including Powell, a conservative commentator and outspoken critic of Mueller's investigation \u2014 who took a far more confrontational stance to the government.\nThe lawyers accused prosecutors of withholding documents and evidence they said was favorable to the case and repeatedly noted that one of the two agents who interviewed Flynn was fired from the FBI for having sent derogatory text messages about Trump during the 2016 campaign.",

Flynn\u2019s case was used in a narrative that Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with the Kremlin in a bid to sway the 2016 election, and the charge against Flynn was about whether he lied about his calls with Sergey Kislyak, the former Russian ambassador to the United States.\nIt is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T.

Then-special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s yearslong investigation didn\u2019t reveal any such collusion.\nA number of Trump supporters believe that Flynn is the victim of politically motivated retaliation by the Obama administration. Flynn\u2019s lawyers, including Powell, accused the FBI of using an entrapment plot to ensnare him.\n\u201cThe pardon of Michael Flynn is solely up to the President, but given the corruption we have witnessed in the judiciary and multiple agencies of government executed against General Flynn, this persecution should end,\u201d Powell told The Epoch Times via email.\n\u201cThe FBI and DOJ have been a national embarrassment for more than 15 years. It was my fervent hope to make our judicial system work to exonerate an innocent man\u2014as all the Left would want were he anyone but Trump or Michael Flynn, but enough is enough. This is sick. It\u2019s painfully obvious Judge Sullivan is playing an evil political game with a good man\u2019s life and family.\u201d\nIn May, the Department of Justice dropped the case, but the presiding district judge, Emmet Sullivan, still hasn\u2019t accepted or denied the dismissal.\nBarr tapped a prosecutor in January to review the case. The review unearthed documents that prompted the prosecutor to recommend that the charges against Flynn should be dropped. Flynn has unsuccessfully asked the appeals court to make Sullivan accept the dismissal. The appeals court also rejected Flynn\u2019s request to make Sullivan recuse himself.\nReports earlier in the day were swirling about whether Trump would pardon Flynn.\n\u201cIt just, frankly, reflects so ill on our democracy, on the United States,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the House Intelligence chair, told CNN. Schiff has been a chief proponent of the Trump\u2013Russia narrative.\nIn July, Trump commuted Roger Stone, a former associate who was charged in the Mueller probe.

Flynn admitted as part of his plea deal to making false statements in filings he submitted to the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\nFlynn reiterated his guilty plea during a court hearing in December 2018, but he began angling months later to withdraw from the agreement.\nHe said in a court filing on Jan. 29, 2019, that he did not intentionally lie to the FBI about his calls with Kislyak, and that he regretted pleading guilty. He said he struck a deal with the government in order to protect his son from possible criminal prosecution in relation to their lobbying for Turkey.\nAfter Flynn retracted his claim of guilt, Attorney General William Barr tapped Jeffrey Jensen, the U.S. attorney for Missouri, to review the handling of Flynn\u2019s case.\nThe Justice Department filed a motion on May 7, to drop charges against Flynn, citing evidence that the FBI had withheld from Flynn\u2019s legal team.\nThe Justice Department has since released FBI documents showing that the bureau planned to close a counterintelligence investigation against Flynn on Jan. 4, 2017, due to a lack of evidence that he was a secret agent of Russia.\nFBI officials intervened to keep the investigation of Flynn open after receiving a transcript of the retired Army general\u2019s calls with Kislyak.\nThe lead FBI agent on Flynn\u2019s case, William Barnett, questioned FBI officials\u2019 rationale for continuing the Flynn investigation.\nBarnett told Jensen during a Sept. 17 interview that he believed the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence case against Flynn was weak, and that he saw no evidence that Flynn was working with Russians.\nBarnett also said that prosecutors on the special counsel\u2019s team had a \u201cget Trump\u201d attitude.\nThe status of Flynn\u2019s case has remained in limbo for months as the judge presiding over the case, Emmet Sullivan, has appealed the Justice Department request to drop charges.\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 25, 2020\nMr. Trump\u2018s pardon of Flynn comes after rampant speculation that he would do so before leaving office in January. More pardons are expected to be issued in the waning days of his administration.\nWhile Mr. Trump had been mum about whether he would pardon Flynn, he frequently expressed support for him. In July, the president said he would welcome Flynn back to the White House.\nFlynn\u2018s attorney, Sidney Powell, said in September that she had discussed the case with Mr. Trump, but said she urged the president not to issue a pardon. But other Flynn supporters have long advocated for one.\nMs. Powell, who was part of the Trump campaign\u2019s legal team trying to challenge the election in states the president lost to presumptive President-elect Joseph R. Biden, took a victory lap on Fox Business Network Wednesday night.\n\u201cWe had passed the point of proving that General Flynn was innocent,\u201d she said in an interview with Lou Dobbs. \u201cAll of the evidence we have gotten since I came on the case shows that.

At the time, Mr. Trump tweeted that he fired Flynn because he lied to Vice President Mike Pence.\nIn 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. in the days before the Trump administration took over.\nFlynn recanted in January, professing his innocence after changing lawyers. He had dropped his high-powered D.C. law firm for Ms. Powell, a conservative firebrand known for criticizing the Mueller probe on cable talk shows.\nThe Justice Department touched off a political firestorm in May, when it reversed course and asked a federal judge to dismiss the charges against Flynn.\nThe stunning reversal prompted one of the prosecutors working the case to resign from it in protest.\nYet the top brass at the Justice Department pushed forward with their goal of abandoning their three-year prosecution of Flynn.\nDepartment lawyers said in court filings that Flynn\u2018s lies to the FBI agents were not \u201cmaterial\u201d to the bureau\u2019s probe into whether Russian agents colluded with the Trump campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election.\nThey also argued that the FBI should not have interviewed Flynn in the first place. The FBI was set to close its investigation into Flynn just weeks before the infamous White House interview because it had not uncovered any wrongdoing.\nHowever, the FBI\u2018s top officials pushed to keep it open, according to Justice Department documents uncovered this year.\nThe judge overseeing Flynn\u2018s case resisted the Justice Department\u2019s calls to immediately dismiss the case. Instead, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan appointed a retired federal judge to argue against the Justice Department and weigh whether Flynn should be slapped with a perjury charge.\nA federal appeals court panel initially held that Judge Sullivan had overstepped his authority by refusing to dismiss the case. But the full court reversed that ruling, returning the case to Judge Sullivan.\nFlynn\u2018s legal case had stalled with no action on it in more than a month.\nFlynn is the latest close associate to have Mr. Trump pardon them or commute their sentence.\nHe commuted the sentences of longtime GOP political adviser Roger Stone and former Illinois Gov.

Trump has refused to concede the election despite Joe Biden being projected the winner almost three weeks ago.\nThe move represents what is likely to be Trump\u2019s closing broadside against the Russia investigation, which dogged his first two years in office and ensured six of his associates including his former campaign chairman and former personal attorney.\nThe move will bring an end to Flynn\u2019s dramatic case, three years after he originally pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators about his contacts with the top Russian diplomat in the United States and agreed to cooperate with Mueller\u2019s investigation. Flynn pleaded guilty to one count of willingly and knowingly making false statements to the FBI as part of a cooperation deal announced in December 2017.\nFlynn moved to withdraw his guilty plea in January 2020, however, after changing his attorneys. The Department of Justice (DOJ) later took the extraordinary step of seeking to drop the charges against the former national security adviser, saying his false statements were not \u201cmaterial\u201d to the investigation.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe case had stalled as Flynn was awaiting sentencing for lying to the FBI. After a failed emergency appeal from Flynn\u2019s legal team, U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan had been weighing the question of whether to grant the Justice Department\u2019s sudden motion to drop its charges.\nThe DOJ reversed course on the prosecution in May, arguing that it no longer had confidence in the FBI investigation that led to Flynn\u2019s interrogation in early 2017.

        "context": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump on Wednesday pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Trump\u2019s pardon, which could be the first of several after he lost the 2020 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden, drew condemnation from Democrats and other critics. A retired Army general, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about interactions he had with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States in the weeks leading up to Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017. He has since sought to withdraw the plea, arguing that prosecutors violated his rights and duped him into a plea agreement. His sentencing has been deferred several times. \u201cIt is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter, a day before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. Flynn\u2019s attorney, Sidney Powell, who told a court in September she personally asked Trump not to pardon her client, said the pardon was \u201cbittersweet\u201d because Flynn was innocent Trump\u2019s move was the highest-profile pardon he has granted since he took office. Among others, the Republican president has pardoned Army personnel accused of war crimes in Afghanistan and Joe Arpaio, a former Arizona sheriff and hardliner against illegal immigration. \u201cThis pardon is undeserved, unprincipled, and one more stain on President Trump\u2019s rapidly diminishing legacy,\u201d House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said in a statement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it \u201can act of grave corruption and a brazen abuse of power.\u201d FILE PHOTO: Former national security adviser Michael Flynn exits a vehicle as he arrives for his sentencing hearing at U.S. District Court in Washington, U.S., December 18, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst MUELLER INVESTIGATION Flynn served as Trump\u2019s first national security adviser but the president fired him after only 24 days for lying to Vice President Mike Pence as controversy broke over the former general\u2019s contacts with then-Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Flynn was one of several former Trump aides to plead guilty or be convicted at trial in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Moscow\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. election to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy. Russia denied meddling. In May, Attorney General William Barr stunned many in the legal community by ordering prosecutors to have the case dropped, a decision that came after Trump repeatedly complained that Flynn was being treated unfairly. Flynn and the Trump administration said U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who presided over the case, was required by law to grant the request for dismissal. An appeals court in August denied Flynn\u2019s request to order Sullivan to end the case. \u201cThe President has pardoned General Flynn because he should never have been prosecuted,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u201cIn fact, the Department of Justice has firmly concluded that the charges against General Flynn should be dropped. This Full Pardon achieves that objective, finally bringing to an end the relentless, partisan pursuit of an innocent man.\u201d The president has spent the days since the Nov. 3 election seeking to overturn the results and refusing to concede to Biden. On Monday, he allowed his administration to take part in a transition to a Biden White House, but he has continued to challenge the election\u2019s legitimacy. With less than two months before Inauguration Day, he could focus his remaining time in office on more pardons and other moves to burnish his legacy. Two former White House officials said more pardons were likely. \u201c\u201dThis is one unfettered presidential power the president enjoys using,\u201d one of them said. \u2018NOT LEARNED HIS LESSON\u2019 Trump said in March he was strongly considering a full pardon for Flynn. He said the FBI and Justice Department had \u201cdestroyed\u201d Flynn\u2019s life and that of his family, and cited an unspecified, unsubstantiated report that they had lost records related to Flynn. Flynn was supposed to help cooperate with the government as part of his plea deal. But he later switched lawyers and tactics, arguing that prosecutors in the case had tricked him into lying about his December 2016 conversations with Kislyak. The Justice Department has repeatedly denied allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, and Sullivan rejected all of Flynn\u2019s claims in December 2019. Federal prosecutors had asked the judge in January to sentence Flynn to up to six months in prison, arguing in a court filing that \u201cthe defendant has not learned his lesson. He has behaved as though the law does not apply to him, and as if there are no consequences for his actions.\u201d Flynn also served as head of the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Intelligence Agency but was forced out in 2014 in part due to his management style and opinions on how to fight Islamist militancy. He joined the Trump 2016 election campaign and at the Republican National Convention that year led supporters in chants of \u201cLock her up,\u201d in reference to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Other former Trump aides were convicted of federal crimes following the Russia inquiry. Trump\u2019s longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone was sentenced on Feb. 20 to three years and four months in prison for obstruction of justice, witness tampering and lying to lawmakers investigating the Russian election interference. Trump commuted his sentence. Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, was sentenced last year to 3-1/2 years in prison after being convicted of unlawful lobbying and witness tampering, which combined with a sentence in a related case equaled a term of more than seven years behind bars. Manafort was released from prison in May and is serving the rest of his sentence at home.",

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\nSurrounded by Army cadets, President Donald Trump watches the first half of the 121st Army-Navy Football Game in Michie Stadium at the United States Military Academy, Saturday, Dec. 12, 2020, in West Point, N.Y. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Contradicting his secretary of state and other top officials, President Donald Trump on Saturday suggested without evidence that China \u2014 not Russia \u2014 may be behind the cyber espionage operation against the United States and tried to minimize its impact.\nIn his first comments on the breach, Trump scoffed at the focus on the Kremlin and downplayed the intrusions, which the nation\u2019s cybersecurity agency has warned posed a \u201cgrave\u201d risk to government and private networks.\n\u201cThe Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality. I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control,\u201d Trump tweeted. He also claimed the media are \u201cpetrified\u201d of \u201cdiscussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!).\u201d\nThere is no evidence to suggest that is the case. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said late Friday that Russia was \u201cpretty clearly\u201d behind the operation against the United States.\n\u201cThis was a very significant effort and I think it\u2019s the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,\u201d Pompeo said in the interview with radio talk show host Mark Levin.\nOfficials at the White House had been prepared to put out a statement Friday afternoon that accused Russia of being \u201cthe main actor\u201d in the hack, but were told at the last minute to stand down, according to one U.S. official familiar with the conversations who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\nIt is not clear whether Pompeo got that message before his interview, but officials are now scrambling to figure out how to square the disparate accounts. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the statement or the basis of Trump\u2019s claims. The State Department also did not respond to questions about Pompeo\u2019s remarks.\nThroughout his presidency, Trump has refused to blame Russia for well-documented hostilities, including its interference in the 2016 election to help him get elected. He blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, has endorsed allowing Russia to return to the G-7 group of nations and has never taken the country to task for allegedly putting bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.\nPompeo in the interview said the government was still \u201cunpacking\u201d the cyberespionage operation and some of it would likely remain classified.\n\u201cBut suffice it to say there was a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside of U.S. government systems and it now appears systems of private companies and companies and governments across the world as well,\u201d he said.\nThough Pompeo was the first Trump administration official to publicly blame Russia for the intrusion, cybersecurity experts and other U.S. officials have been clear over the past week that the operation appears to be the work of Russia. There has been no credible suggestion that any other country \u2014 including China \u2014 is responsible.\nDemocrats in Congress who have received classified briefings have also affirmed publicly that Russia, which in 2014 hacked the State Department and interfered through hacking in the 2016 presidential election, was behind it.\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly what the hackers were seeking, but experts say it could include nuclear secrets, blueprints for advanced weaponry, COVID-19 vaccine-related research and information for dossiers on government and industry leaders.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRussia has said it had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with the hacking.\nWhile Trump downplayed the impact of the hacks, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has said it compromised federal agencies as well as \u201ccritical infrastructure.\u201d Homeland Security, the agency\u2019s parent department, defines such infrastructure as any \u201cvital\u201d assets to the U.S. or its economy, a broad category that could include power plants and financial institutions.\nOne U.S. official, speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss a matter that is under investigation, described the hack as severe and extremely damaging.\n\u201cThis is looking like it\u2019s the worst hacking case in the history of America,\u201d the official said. \u201cThey got into everything.\u201d\nTrump had been silent on the hacks before Saturday.\nDeputy White House press secretary Brian Morgenstern on Friday declined to discuss the matter, but told reporters that national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien had sometimes been leading multiple daily meetings with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence agencies, looking for ways to mitigate the hack.\n\u201cRest assured we have the best and brightest working hard on it each and every single day,\u201d he said.\nThe Democratic leaders of four House committees given classified briefings by the administration on the hack have complained that they \u201cwere left with more questions than answers.\u201d\n\u201cAdministration officials were unwilling to share the full scope of the breach and identities of the victims,\u201d they said.\nPompeo, in the interview with Levin, said Russia was on the list of \u201cfolks that want to undermine our way of life, our republic, our basic democratic principles. ... You see the news of the day with respect to their efforts in the cyberspace. We\u2019ve seen this for an awfully long time, using asymmetric capabilities to try and put themselves in a place where they can impose costs on the United States.\u201d\nWhat makes this hacking campaign so extraordinary is its scale: 18,000 organizations were infected from March to June by malicious code that piggybacked on popular network-management software from an Austin, Texas, company called SolarWinds.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt\u2019s going to take months to kick elite hackers out of the U.S. government networks they have been quietly rifling through since as far back as March.\nExperts say there simply are not enough skilled threat-hunting teams to duly identify all the government and private-sector systems that may have been hacked. FireEye, the cybersecurity company that discovered the intrusion into U.S. agencies and was among the victims, has already tallied dozens of casualties. It\u2019s racing to identify more.\nMany federal workers \u2014 and others in the private sector \u2014 must presume that unclassified networks are teeming with spies. Agencies will be more inclined to conduct sensitive government business on Signal, WhatsApp and other encrypted smartphone apps.\nIf the hackers are indeed from Russia\u2019s SVR foreign intelligence agency, as experts believe, their resistance may be tenacious.\nThe only way to be sure a network is clean is \u201cto burn it down to the ground and rebuild it,\u201d said Bruce Schneier, a prominent security expert and Harvard fellow.\nFlorida became the first state to acknowledge falling victim to a SolarWinds hack. Officials told The Associated Press that hackers apparently infiltrated the state\u2019s health care administration agency and others.\nSolarWinds\u2019 customers include most Fortune 500 companies, and its U.S. government clients are rich with generals and spymasters.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Frank Bajak in Boston, Eric Tucker in Washington and Bobby Caina Calvan in Tallahassee, Florida, contributed to this report.",
            "(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, in his first comments about a widespread data breach across the U.S. government, on Saturday downplayed the cyber espionage campaign and questioned whether Russia was to blame as alleged by his own top diplomat.\n\u201cThe Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality,\u201d Trump said on Twitter on Saturday. \u201cRussia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!).\u201d\nTrump\u2019s assertion that China may be behind the hacking spree, which has so far affected more than a half dozen federal agencies including the Commerce and Treasury Departments, runs counter to comments by his own secretary of State and multiple lawmakers briefed on the matter.\n\u201cWe can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,\u201d said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday in an interview. Republican lawmaker Mitt Romney in a tweet on Thursday said the hack was \u201clike Russian bombers have been repeatedly flying undetected over our entire country.\u201d\nA State Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.\n\ufeff\u201dAt this time the NSC is focused on investigating the circumstances surrounding this incident, and working with our interagency partners to mitigate the situation. There will be an appropriate response to those actors behind this conduct,\u201d said National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot in an email.\nAdding to the confusion sown by Trump\u2019s tweets, an administration source said that White House officials drafted and were ready to release a statement on Friday that Russia was behind the massive cyber intrusion.\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump departs on travel to West Point, New York from the South Lawn at the White House in Washington, U.S., December 12, 2020.

Another dishonest tweet that sounds like it could have been written in the Kremlin.\u201d\nThe Kremlin has denied any involvement.\nIn his tweet, Trump tagged Pompeo and Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe.\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, has yet to publicly comment on who is behind the massive data breach, which exploited a piece of software developed by network management firm SolarWinds that is widely used throughout the public and private sectors.\nA spokesperson for ODNI did not respond to a request for comment.\nDaniel Hoffman, a former CIA Moscow station chief, said the Trump administration needed to explain quickly why Pompeo blamed Russia, while the president cast doubt on that assessment.\nHe noted that Pompeo served as CIA director before becoming the top U.S. diplomat, and he has \u201can extremely sophisticated understanding of national security. How is it that he attributed the attack to Russia and the president did not?\u201d\nHoffman said that \u201cbased on everything we know,\u201d the hack was directed by Russia\u2019s external intelligence service, known as the SVR, using APT29, the Russian hacking group known as \u201cCozy Bear.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to speculate that it\u2019s somebody else.

            "\u00a9 Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attend the coronavirus task force press briefing at the White House on March 20.\nPresident Trump addressed the ongoing cyber hacks of the U.S. government for the first time on Saturday, seeking to turn blame away from Moscow in defiance of mounting evidence while downplaying how devastating the intrusions appear to be.\nIn a bizarre outburst on Twitter that Trump\u2019s critics condemned for its alarming disconnect from the facts, the president contradicted his top diplomat, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who on Friday pinned the breaches that have afflicted at least five major federal agencies \u201cclearly\u201d on Russia. Rather, the president baselessly suggested that the true culprit \u201cmay be China (it may!)\u201d\nTrump\u2019s aversion to calling out the Kremlin for its malign activities in cyberspace and his deference to Russian President Vladimir Putin has become a hallmark of his presidency. He has repeatedly trusted the word of Putin over the assessments of his own intelligence community, including its conclusion that Russia waged a sophisticated campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential election \u2014 a verdict Trump believes calls into question the legitimacy of his victory four years ago.\nHis tweets Saturday raise fresh concerns that he will seek to shrug off what may turn out to be a cyber hack of unprecedented scale, and that Russia will not be held to account. The president has complained to advisers, who believe Russia is culpable, that the intrusions are a fake narrative meant to damage him politically.\n\u201cThe Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality,\u201d Trump tweeted, despite a federal alert in recent days that called the widespread cyber espionage campaign \u201ca grave risk to\u201d government agencies and the private sector.\n\u201cI have been fully briefed and everything is well under control,\u201d he said, while agencies are scrambling to investigate and contain major breaches at agencies including the State, Treasury, Energy, Homeland Security and Commerce departments \u2014 an effort that is likely to take months.\nHe also speculated, with no evidence, that the hacks may also have included \u201ca hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big.\u201d Twitter flagged that assertion, saying that \u201cmultiple sources called this election differently.\u201d There is no evidence that November\u2019s election was undermined by significant or widespread fraud, despite Trump\u2019s insistence otherwise.\nTrump had, until Saturday, studiously avoided the topic, reluctant to address publicly an issue that has bedeviled him since he took office: Russia\u2019s hacking of U.S. targets. He broke his silence only after he was criticized publicly by lawmakers from both parties for an apparent unwillingness to confront Putin.\nWhite House officials had drafted a statement to be released Friday accusing Moscow of carrying out the cyber intrusions in a months-long campaign, but they were blocked from doing so, said a senior administration official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter\u2019s sensitivity.\nBut Pompeo, in an interview on \u201cThe Mark Levin Show,\u201d had no qualms about speaking out. \u201cThis was a very significant effort,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think it\u2019s the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity.\u201d\nPompeo did not specify which branch of the Russian government carried out the campaign, but U.S. officials have privately said they believe it is the foreign intelligence service, the SVR, a successor agency to the KGB. None have suggested that China played any role.\nMoscow has denied any involvement in the intrusions. Federal agencies were first revealed to have been hacked last weekend.\nPompeo said he could not say much more as the investigations were ongoing. \u201cBut suffice it to say, there was a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside of U.S. government systems, and it now appears systems of private companies and companies and governments across the world as well,\u201d he told Levin, a syndicated radio talk show host.\nHis remarks come as government agencies and affected companies race to figure out the scope of the breaches, how the Russians carried them off without being detected for months and how to prevent future compromises.\nThe president is intent on turning the conversation to China and its coercive activities in the technology and economic spheres and its human rights abuses, a second official said. He has directed advisers to look for ways in the waning days of his administration to confront Beijing over those issues, the official said.\nTrump\u2019s comments Saturday reflect a long-running disregard for the facts and his disinterest in what he calls \u201cthe cyber,\u201d analysts and former aides said. \u201cStarting with Trump\u2019s very first meeting with Putin to today\u2019s tweets we\u2019ve seen an almost unbreakable pattern of denying the obvious about Russia\u2019s misdeeds while carrying water for the Kremlin,\u201d said Andrew Weiss, a Russia expert and vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cTrump\u2019s comments are totally divorced from reality.\u201d\nGregory F. Treverton, a former chairman of the National Intelligence Council, the government\u2019s senior-most provider of intelligence analysis, said that Trump \u201cbehaves so much like a paid Russian agent.\u201d\n\u201cIf you look at the string of his actions and pronouncements,\u201d Treverton said, \u201cthe only consistent interpretation that you can logically draw is that he\u2019s in their thrall.\u201d\n\u00a9 Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images President Trump walks with Russian President Vladimir Putin at last year\u2019s G-20 Summit in Osaka, Japan.\nThe Obama administration saw that campaign, as disturbing as it was, as classic espionage of the sort that states routinely engage in against each other, rather than as a disruptive attack, and so did not retaliate, said Michael Daniel, who was Obama\u2019s White House cyber coordinator. Officials were not aware of the thousands of other victims in the private sector and other countries at the time, he said. The administration never publicly accused Russia of perpetrating the hacks.\nThis time, the context is different. There is widespread publicity around the breaches, which could turn out to be unprecedented in scale. The nature of the compromises, involving corruption of software commonly used by thousands of large organizations around the globe, is alarming. And the public is much more attuned to Russia\u2019s malign activity in cyberspace, in the wake of its 2016 election interference.\nThus far, there is no sign that the intrusions have resulted in disruption or destruction, and the SVR is known mostly for conducting espionage. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, the activity is not a precursor to something beyond spying, some analysts said.\nIn any case, Pompeo\u2019s \u201cattribution is a very important step,\u201d said Tom Bossert, who was Trump\u2019s homeland security adviser until April 2018. \u201cThe United States can now direct its focus and unite the world against this outrage.\u201d\nHe said the Russian government is holding American networks at risk. \u201cWe must impose a cost on the Russians,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil we start defending digital infrastructure as if commercial and government operations depended on it, we will remain rudderless.\u201d\nMicrosoft, a major software and cloud provider, alerted several federal agencies last weekend to the fact that they were breached, its president Brad Smith told The Washington Post in an interview this past week.\n\u201cNo one should be shocked that a company like Microsoft would be the first to identify any particular customer that has been breached,\u201d he said.\nSmith said so far the company has notified a little more than 40 customers who were breached, and that 80 percent of them were in the United States. The others were in Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Spain, Britain, Israel and the United Arab Emirates.\nBritain so far has seen only a small number of victims, all in the private sector.\nA major avenue for breaching victims\u2019 networks was an update for computer software made by a Texas-based company called SolarWinds. The firm said about 18,000 customers that received the patch, for network management software called Orion, were potentially exposed. The Russians covertly added malware to the update, which installed a back door on computers that the hackers could use to enter a victim\u2019s system at will.\nBut the intruders were selective in choosing who to compromise. Not everyone who downloaded the patch was seen as an attractive target, Microsoft said.\nThe SolarWinds update was not the only path into victims\u2019 networks, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in an alert this past week. \u201cCISA has evidence of additional initial access vectors, other than the SolarWinds Orion platform; however, these are still being investigated,\u201d the agency said.\nMicrosoft is itself a SolarWinds customer and acknowledged in a statement this past week it had found SolarWinds malware \u201cin our environment,\u201d which it isolated and removed.\nIn his interview with The Post, Smith said none of Microsoft\u2019s customers had been breached through the software giant. \u201cI think we can give you a blanket answer that affirmatively states, no, we are not aware of any customers being attacked through Microsoft\u2019s cloud services or any of our other services, for that matter, by this hacker.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cLots of people have been hacked and a lot of the people that have been hacked happen to be Microsoft customers and Microsoft cloud customers. But that doesn\u2019t mean they were hacked or attacked through the Microsoft cloud.\u201d\nSmith in a blog post called for the establishment of a global norm forbidding the type of \u201cbroad and reckless activity\u201d used against SolarWinds and its customers, which threatened the integrity of the broader software supply chain.\nA norm against compromising that supply chain would \u201ckneecap intelligence collection\u201d by western democracies, said Thomas Rid, a cyber espionage expert at Johns Hopkins University. Worse, nondemocratic states would not abide by it, he said. \u201cSome of the most successful western intelligence operations were supply chain compromises,\u201d he said, citing a decades-long operation in which rigged encryption machines allowed U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on dozens of countries undetected.\nDaniel, the former White House cyber coordinator, said a broad-based supply chain compromise that affects many different organizations indiscriminately \u201cshould probably be frowned upon.\u201d But, he said, to argue that a western spy agency is never going to use the supply chain to spy on an adversary is unrealistic. \u201cFor a well-defended adversary,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s something you may want to consider.\u201d\nKaren DeYoung contributed to this report.",

But CISA said in an updated advisory Saturday that it has found signs of the hackers' activity even in cases where the victims hadn't used SolarWinds' platform \u2014 adding to suspicions that SolarWinds wasn't the only weakness the attackers exploited, \u201dand there may still be others that are not yet known.\u201d\n\u201dThis is a patient, well-resourced, and focused adversary that has sustained long duration activity on victim networks,\u201d the agency said in an earlier update. It called the attack \u201da grave risk to the Federal Government and state, local, tribal, and territorial governments\u201d as well as private organizations.\nThe massive and sophisticated cyber operation infiltrated the departments of Treasury, Homeland Security, State and Agriculture; the National Institutes of Health, and the Commerce Department\u2019s telecommunications policy agency, among other targets.\nThe Department of Energy has found evidence that hackers breached networks at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, two national laboratories, a DOE field office and a division of the National Nuclear Security Administration.\nPompeo defended Trump for not speaking out sooner on the attack.\n\u201cI saw this in my time running the world\u2019s premier espionage service at the CIA.

But suffice it to say there was a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside of U.S. government systems and it now appears systems of private companies and companies and governments across the world as well,\u201d Pompeo said on \u201dThe Mark Levin Show.\u201d\n\u201dThis was a very significant effort, and I think it's the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,\u201d he added.\nPompeo was the first major government official to publicly blame Russia, though members of Congress and outside experts had widely concluded that Moscow was behind the intrusion.\nThe hack, which entered government systems through targeted third-party software contractor SolarWinds, blindsided the U.S. government and laid bare both cyber vulnerabilities throughout the government's systems and Russia's aggressive posture in cyberspace.\n\u201dWe shouldn't have been surprised, the Russians are very sophisticated, they are very dedicated and relentless, and this appeared to be a soft target they were able to exploit,\u201d Christopher Painter, the former State Department cybersecurity coordinator under both the Trump and Obama administrations, told The Hill on Friday.\nThe expansive hack led lawmakers to call on the White House to take action, including specifically condemning the intrusion and signing the annual defense policy bill, which includes several cybersecurity provisions, but Trump has threatened to veto over other issues.\nThe administration had already organized a cyber coordination group composed of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to respond to the hack, but at least one lawmaker hit Trump over his silence over the attack.\n\u201dI think the White House needs to say something aggressive about what happened. This is almost as if you had a Russian bomber flying undetected over the country, including over the nation's capital, and not to respond in a setting like that is really stunning,\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said in an interview this week.\nThe Saturday morning remarks from Trump followed a pattern of him being wary of criticizing Moscow over cyber threats. The president notably refused to accept that Moscow interfered in the 2016 election to boost his campaign, at times dismissing the intelligence community's overwhelming assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin was behind the plot.\nIt is unclear what kind of response the administration will launch, particularly as Trump focuses his remaining time in office railing against his election loss, but outside voices have called on the White House to launch a counterstrike to deter future Russian hacks.\n\u201dThe top priority has got to be, if we determine it's the Russians, that's where the information tends to point, what the retaliation is going to be,\u201d John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, said after the attack. \u201dAnd I think it ought to be, whatever we assess what the cost we incur to be - plus, plus, plus.

Twitter flagged the president's tweet, noting that the election has been certified for Joe Biden.\nU.S. intelligence agencies and experts have not linked China to this hack, which began at least as early as March, though it was discovered only last week.

            "\u00a9 Getty Images Donald Trump and Mike Pompeo\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday downplayed a massive cyberattack on US federal government agencies, contradicting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's public remarks linking the hack to Russia and leaving administration officials scrambling to reconcile the competing statements, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\u201dThis was a very significant effort, and I think it's the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,\u201d Pompeo had said of the cyber hack in an interview Friday on \u201dThe Mark Levin Show,\u201d adding: \u201dI can't say much more as we're still unpacking precisely what it is, and I'm sure some of it will remain classified.\u201d\nBut Trump, in his first public comments on the issue, appeared to undercut Pompeo's remarks in a pair of tweets Saturday, suggesting without evidence \u201dit may be China\u201d that's responsible. Instead of condemning the attack, or Russia, he wrote that he had been \u201dfully briefed and everything is well under control\u201d -- despite officials in his administration having said this week that the cyberattack \u201dposes a grave risk\u201d to networks across both the public and private sector.\nWhite House officials had drafted a statement assigning blame to Russia for the attack and were preparing to release it Friday afternoon but were told to stand down, according to people familiar with the plans. Officials initially weren't told why the statement was pulled back.\nThe statement, the people said, placed blame on Russia for orchestrating the attack but left open the possibility that other actors were involved.\nThe people familiar told CNN on Saturday it wasn't clear whether the statement will be released, and instead described a scramble inside the administration as officials work to reconcile the competing statements from Trump and Pompeo.\nThe President was briefed on the attack on Thursday.\nTrump also baselessly claimed in the tweets that the attack could have impacted US voting machines. A group of national, state and private election officials said in a joint statement last month that there is no evidence of any voting system being compromised in the 2020 election.\nAt least half a dozen federal agencies are now known to have been targeted in the breach, including the Department of Homeland Security's cyber arm and the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy and State. Investigators are still trying to determine what, if any, government data may have been accessed or stolen in the hack.\n\u201dSuffice it to say, there was a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside of US government systems and it now appears systems of private companies and companies and governments across the world as well,\u201d Pompeo said.\nTrump had remained silent on the hack for most of the week. The White House said Friday the President was being briefed and \u201dworking very hard\u201d in dealing with it.\nAsked Friday about Trump's silence on the matter, Pompeo noted there was work going on behind the scenes.\n\u201dThere are many things that you'd very much love to say, 'Boy, I'm going to call that out,' but a wiser course of action to protect the American people is to calmly go about your business and defend freedom,\u201d he said.\nAs the scope of the espionage campaign and its sophistication became clearer over the past two weeks, US officials had begun to believe that a Russia-linked entity or Russian individuals are responsible for the attacks. Pompeo's comments go further than any Trump administration official yet in pinning the blame on Russia, as further evidence shows the hacking operation bears all the hallmarks of a Russian-backed actor.\nThe Russian embassy in Washington has denied involvement in the hack.\nBut Moscow has been linked to several recent breaches, including the 2016 hacking of Democratic officials during the US presidential election.\nLast week, the cybersecurity firm FireEye disclosed that it had been targeted by a sophisticated, likely state-sponsored espionage attempt, and that several of its own hacking tools had been stolen.\nCNN previously reported that a Russian-affiliated group known as APT29 was behind the attack on FireEye.\nOn Sunday, Reuters first reported that the Departments of Commerce and Treasury had been hit by hackers. The Commerce Department soon confirmed a security incident.\nThat same evening, FireEye identified the source of its own intrusion as malware hidden in its software updates published by the software vendor SolarWinds, which is used by a number of federal civilian agencies for network management.\nAs many as 18,000 SolarWinds customers, including US government agencies and Fortune 500 companies, had been sent the updates containing the malware.\nThe headline and story have been updated to reflect President Donald Trump's tweets on the cyberattack and additional reporting.",

He blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, has endorsed allowing Russia to return to the G7 group of nations and has never taken the country to task for allegedly putting bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.\nCybersecurity experts and other U.S. officials have been clear over the past week that the operation appears to be the work of Russia. There has been no credible suggestion that any other country \u2014 including China \u2014 is responsible.\nDemocrats in Congress who have received classified briefings have also affirmed publicly that Russia was behind it.\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly what the hackers were seeking, but experts say it could include nuclear secrets, blueprints for advanced weaponry, COVID-19 vaccine-related research and information for dossiers on government and industry leaders.\nSerious hack that could have compromised financial institutions and power plants\nWhile Trump downplayed the impact of the hacks, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has said it compromised federal agencies as well as \u201ccritical infrastructure.\u201d Homeland Security, the agency\u2019s parent department, defines such infrastructure as any \u201cvital\u201d assets to the U.S. or its economy, a broad category that could include power plants and financial institutions.\n\u201cWorst hacking case in the history of America\u201d\nOne U.S. official, speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss a matter that is under investigation, described the hack as severe and extremely damaging.\n\u201cThis is looking like it\u2019s the worst hacking case in the history of America,\u201d the official said. \u201cThey got into everything.\u201d\nTrump had been silent on the attacks before Saturday.\nDeputy White House press secretary Brian Morgenstern on Friday declined to discuss the matter, but told reporters that national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien had sometimes been leading multiple daily meetings with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence agencies, looking for ways to mitigate the hack.\n\u201cRest assured we have the best and brightest working hard on it each and every single day,\u201d he said.\nThe Democratic leaders of four House committees given classified briefings by the administration on the hack issued a statement complaining that they \u201cwere left with more questions than answers.\u201d\n\u201cAdministration officials were unwilling to share the full scope of the breach and identities of the victims,\u201d they said.\nPompeo, in the interview with Levin, said Russia was on the list of \u201cfolks that want to undermine our way of life, our republic, our basic democratic principles. [...] You see the news of the day with respect to their efforts in the cyberspace. We\u2019ve seen this for an awfully long time, using asymmetric capabilities to try and put themselves in a place where they can impose costs on the United States.\u201d\nAn extensive, long-lasting attack\nWhat makes this hacking campaign so extraordinary is its scale: 18,000 organizations were infected from March to June by malicious code that piggybacked on popular network-management software from an Austin, Texas, company called SolarWinds.\nIt\u2019s going to take months to kick elite hackers out of the U.S. government networks they have been quietly rifling through since as far back as March.\nExperts say there simply are not enough skilled threat-hunting teams to duly identify all the government and private-sector systems that may have been hacked. FireEye, the cybersecurity company that discovered the intrusion into U.S. agencies and was among the victims, has already tallied dozens of casualties. It's racing to identify more.\nMany federal workers \u2014 and others in the private sector \u2014 must presume that unclassified networks are teeming with spies. Agencies will be more inclined to conduct sensitive government business on Signal, WhatsApp and other encrypted smartphone apps.\nOnly way to secure hacked networks is to restart from scratch\nIf the hackers are indeed from Russia\u2019s SVR foreign intelligence agency, as experts believe, their resistance may be tenacious.\nThe only way to be sure a network is clean is \u201cto burn it down to the ground and rebuild it,\u201d said Bruce Schneier, a prominent security expert and Harvard fellow.\nFlorida became the first state to acknowledge falling victim to a SolarWinds hack.

He has repeatedly trusted the word of Putin over the assessments of his own intelligence community, including its conclusion that Russia waged a sophisticated campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential election \u2014 a verdict Trump believes calls into question the legitimacy of his victory four years ago.\nHis tweets Saturday raise fresh concerns that he will seek to shrug off what may turn out to be a cyber hack of unprecedented scale, and that Russia will not be held to account. The president has complained to advisers, who believe Russia is culpable, that the intrusions are a fake narrative meant to damage him politically.\n\u201cThe Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality,\u201d Trump tweeted, despite a federal alert in recent days that called the widespread cyber espionage campaign \u201ca grave risk to\u201d government agencies and the private sector.\n\u201cI have been fully briefed and everything is well under control,\u201d he said, while agencies are scrambling to investigate and contain major breaches at agencies including the State, Treasury, Energy, Homeland Security and Commerce departments \u2014 an effort that is likely to take months.\nHe also speculated, with no evidence, that the hacks may also have included \u201ca hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big.\u201d Twitter flagged that assertion, saying that \u201cmultiple sources called this election differently.\u201d There is no evidence that November\u2019s election was undermined by significant or widespread fraud, despite Trump\u2019s insistence otherwise.\nSince Nov. 4, President Trump has repeatedly claimed his election loss as a result of massive fraud. The following is a roundup of his claims. (The Washington Post)\nTrump had, until Saturday, studiously avoided the topic, reluctant to address publicly an issue that has bedeviled him since he took office: Russia\u2019s hacking of U.S. targets. He broke his silence only after he was criticized publicly by lawmakers from both parties for an apparent unwillingness to confront Putin.\nWhite House officials had drafted a statement to be released Friday accusing Moscow of carrying out the cyber intrusions in a months-long campaign, but they were blocked from doing so, said a senior administration official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter\u2019s sensitivity.\nBut Pompeo, in an interview on \u201cThe Mark Levin Show,\u201d had no qualms about speaking out. \u201cThis was a very significant effort,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think it\u2019s the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity.\u201d\nPompeo did not specify which branch of the Russian government carried out the campaign, but U.S. officials have privately said they believe it is the foreign intelligence service, the SVR, a successor agency to the KGB. None have suggested that China played any role.\nMoscow has denied any involvement in the intrusions. Federal agencies were first revealed to have been hacked last weekend.\nPompeo said he could not say much more as the investigations were ongoing. \u201cBut suffice it to say, there was a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside of U.S. government systems, and it now appears systems of private companies and companies and governments across the world as well,\u201d he told Levin, a syndicated radio talk show host.\nHis remarks come as government agencies and affected companies race to figure out the scope of the breaches, how the Russians carried them off without being detected for months and how to prevent future compromises.\nThe president is intent on turning the conversation to China and its coercive activities in the technology and economic spheres and its human rights abuses, a second official said. He has directed advisers to look for ways in the waning days of his administration to confront Beijing over those issues, the official said.\nTrump\u2019s comments Saturday reflect a long-running disregard for the facts and his disinterest in what he calls \u201cthe cyber,\u201d analysts and former aides said. \u201cStarting with Trump\u2019s very first meeting with Putin to today\u2019s tweets we\u2019ve seen an almost unbreakable pattern of denying the obvious about Russia\u2019s misdeeds while carrying water for the Kremlin,\u201d said Andrew Weiss, a Russia expert and vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cTrump\u2019s comments are totally divorced from reality.\u201d\nGregory F. Treverton, a former chairman of the National Intelligence Council, the government\u2019s senior-most provider of intelligence analysis, said that Trump \u201cbehaves so much like a paid Russian agent.\u201d\n\u201cIf you look at the string of his actions and pronouncements,\u201d Treverton said, \u201cthe only consistent interpretation that you can logically draw is that he\u2019s in their thrall.\u201d\nThe Obama administration saw that campaign, as disturbing as it was, as classic espionage of the sort that states routinely engage in against each other, rather than as a disruptive attack, and so did not retaliate, said Michael Daniel, who was Obama\u2019s White House cyber coordinator. Officials were not aware of the thousands of other victims in the private sector and other countries at the time, he said. The administration never publicly accused Russia of perpetrating the hacks.\nThis time, the context is different. There is widespread publicity around the breaches, which could turn out to be unprecedented in scale. The nature of the compromises, involving corruption of software commonly used by thousands of large organizations around the globe, is alarming. And the public is much more attuned to Russia\u2019s malign activity in cyberspace, in the wake of its 2016 election interference.\nThus far, there is no sign that the intrusions have resulted in disruption or destruction, and the SVR is known mostly for conducting espionage. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, the activity is not a precursor to something beyond spying, some analysts said.\nIn any case, Pompeo\u2019s \u201cattribution is a very important step,\u201d said Tom Bossert, who was Trump\u2019s homeland security adviser until April 2018. \u201cThe United States can now direct its focus and unite the world against this outrage.\u201d\nHe said the Russian government is holding American networks at risk. \u201cWe must impose a cost on the Russians,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil we start defending digital infrastructure as if commercial and government operations depended on it, we will remain rudderless.\u201d\nMicrosoft, a major software and cloud provider, alerted several federal agencies last weekend to the fact that they were breached, its president Brad Smith told The Washington Post in an interview this past week.\n\u201cNo one should be shocked that a company like Microsoft would be the first to identify any particular customer that has been breached,\u201d he said.\nSmith said so far the company has notified a little more than 40 customers who were breached, and that 80 percent of them were in the United States. The others were in Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Spain, Britain, Israel and the United Arab Emirates.\nBritain so far has seen only a small number of victims, all in the private sector.\nA major avenue for breaching victims\u2019 networks was an update for computer software made by a Texas-based company called SolarWinds. The firm said about 18,000 customers that received the patch, for network management software called Orion, were potentially exposed. The Russians covertly added malware to the update, which installed a back door on computers that the hackers could use to enter a victim\u2019s system at will.\nBut the intruders were selective in choosing who to compromise. Not everyone who downloaded the patch was seen as an attractive target, Microsoft said.\nThe SolarWinds update was not the only path into victims\u2019 networks, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in an alert this past week. \u201cCISA has evidence of additional initial access vectors, other than the SolarWinds Orion platform; however, these are still being investigated,\u201d the agency said.\nMicrosoft is itself a SolarWinds customer and acknowledged in a statement this past week it had found SolarWinds malware \u201cin our environment,\u201d which it isolated and removed.\nIn his interview with The Post, Smith said none of Microsoft\u2019s customers had been breached through the software giant. \u201cI think we can give you a blanket answer that affirmatively states, no, we are not aware of any customers being attacked through Microsoft\u2019s cloud services or any of our other services, for that matter, by this hacker.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cLots of people have been hacked and a lot of the people that have been hacked happen to be Microsoft customers and Microsoft cloud customers. But that doesn\u2019t mean they were hacked or attacked through the Microsoft cloud.\u201d\nSmith in a blog post called for the establishment of a global norm forbidding the type of \u201cbroad and reckless activity\u201d used against SolarWinds and its customers, which threatened the integrity of the broader software supply chain.\nA norm against compromising that supply chain would \u201ckneecap intelligence collection\u201d by western democracies, said Thomas Rid, a cyber espionage expert at Johns Hopkins University. Worse, nondemocratic states would not abide by it, he said. \u201cSome of the most successful western intelligence operations were supply chain compromises,\u201d he said, citing a decades-long operation in which rigged encryption machines allowed U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on dozens of countries undetected.\nDaniel, the former White House cyber coordinator, said a broad-based supply chain compromise that affects many different organizations indiscriminately \u201cshould probably be frowned upon.\u201d But, he said, to argue that a western spy agency is never going to use the supply chain to spy on an adversary is unrealistic. \u201cFor a well-defended adversary,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s something you may want to consider.\u201d",
            "Contradicting his secretary of State and other top officials, President Trump on Saturday suggested without evidence that China \u2014 not Russia \u2014 may be behind the cyberattack against the United States and tried to downplay its impact.\nIn his first comments on the breach, Trump scoffed at the focus on the Kremlin and minimized the intrusions, which the nation\u2019s cybersecurity agency has warned posed a \u201cgrave\u201d risk to government and private networks.\n\u201cThe Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality. I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control,\u201d Trump tweeted. He also claimed the media are \u201cpetrified\u201d of \u201cdiscussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!).\u201d\nThere is no evidence to suggest that is the case.

The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the statement or the basis of Trump\u2019s claims.\nThroughout his presidency, Trump has refused to blame Russia for well-documented hostilities, including its interference in the 2016 election to help him get elected. He blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, has endorsed allowing Russia to return to the Group of 7 of nations and has never taken the country to task for allegedly putting bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.\nAdvertisement\nPompeo in the interview said the government was still \u201cunpacking\u201d the cyberattack and some of the details would likely remain classified.\n\u201cBut suffice it to say there was a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside of U.S. government systems and it now appears systems of private companies and companies and governments across the world as well,\u201d he said.\nThough Pompeo was the first Trump administration official to publicly blame Russia for the attacks, cybersecurity experts and other U.S. officials have been clear over the past week that the operation appears to be the work of Russia.

The move was first reported by the Associated Press.\nThe official did not say who gave the instruction to stand down.\nThe White House and the State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday. The Chinese Embassy in Washington also did not respond.\n\u201dAt this time the NSC is focused on investigating the circumstances surrounding this incident, and working with our interagency partners to mitigate the situation. There will be an appropriate response to those actors behind this conduct,\u201d National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot said in a statement Saturday.\nTrump also baselessly claimed on Twitter on Saturday that the hack could have impacted voting machines, continuing his campaign to discredit the 2020 election results. Twitter flagged the president's tweet, noting that the election has been certified for Joe Biden.\nU.S. intelligence agencies and experts have not linked China to this hack, which began at least as early as March, though it was discovered only last week. Trump did not provide any information in his tweet as to why he believes China could be involved.\nThe hack is being described as one of the most successful cyber infiltrations of U.S. government and corporate institutions in history.\nJust hours before Trump's tweet, Pompeo, a close ally of the president, said in interview on the \u201dMark Levin Show\u201d that he believed Russia was behind the hack.\n\u201dI can't say much more as we're still unpacking precisely what it is, and I'm sure some of it will remain classified,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201dThis was a very significant effort, and I think it's the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity.\u201d\nWhen asked if Trump would speak out during the investigation, Pompeo said sometimes the \u201dwiser course of action to protect the American people is to calmly go about your business and defend freedom.\u201d\nTrump has been criticized by President-elect Joe Biden for letting the massive security breach happen under his watch and for his past silence on the issue.\n\u201dWe need to disrupt and deter our adversaries from undertaking significant cyber attacks in the first place,\u201d Biden said in a statement earlier this week. \u201dOur adversaries should know that, as president, I will not stand idly by in the face of cyber assaults on our nation.\u201d",
            "Trump downplays Russia in first comments on hacking campaign President Donald Trump is suggesting without evidence that China \u2014 not Russia \u2014 may be behind the the grave cyber espionage operation against the United States\nWASHINGTON -- Contradicting his secretary of state and other top officials, President Donald Trump on Saturday suggested without evidence that China \u2014 not Russia \u2014 may be behind the cyber espionage operation against the United States and tried to minimize its impact.\nIn his first comments on the breach, Trump scoffed at the focus on the Kremlin and downplayed the intrusions, which the nation\u2019s cybersecurity agency has warned posed a \u201cgrave\u201d risk to government and private networks.\n\u201cThe Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality. I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control,\u201d Trump tweeted. He also claimed the media are \u201cpetrified\u201d of \u201cdiscussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!).\u201d\nThere is no evidence to suggest that is the case. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said late Friday that Russia was \u201cpretty clearly\u201d behind the operation against the United States.\n\u201cThis was a very significant effort and I think it\u2019s the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,\u201d Pompeo said in the interview with radio talk show host Mark Levin.\nOfficials at the White House had been prepared to put out a statement Friday afternoon that accused Russia of being \u201cthe main actor\u201d in the hack, but were told at the last minute to stand down, according to one U.S. official familiar with the conversations who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\nIt is not clear whether Pompeo got that message before his interview, but officials are now scrambling to figure out how to square the disparate accounts. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the statement or the basis of Trump's claims. The State Department also did not respond to questions about Pompeo's remarks.\nThroughout his presidency, Trump has refused to blame Russia for well-documented hostilities, including its interference in the 2016 election to help him get elected. He blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, has endorsed allowing Russia to return to the G-7 group of nations and has never taken the country to task for allegedly putting bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.\nPompeo in the interview said the government was still \u201cunpacking\u201d the cyberespionage operation and some of it would likely remain classified.\n\u201cBut suffice it to say there was a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside of U.S. government systems and it now appears systems of private companies and companies and governments across the world as well,\u201d he said.\nThough Pompeo was the first Trump administration official to publicly blame Russia for the intrusion, cybersecurity experts and other U.S. officials have been clear over the past week that the operation appears to be the work of Russia. There has been no credible suggestion that any other country \u2014 including China \u2014 is responsible.\nDemocrats in Congress who have received classified briefings have also affirmed publicly that Russia, which in 2014 hacked the State Department and interfered through hacking in the 2016 presidential election, was behind it.\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly what the hackers were seeking, but experts say it could include nuclear secrets, blueprints for advanced weaponry, COVID-19 vaccine-related research and information for dossiers on government and industry leaders.\nRussia has said it had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with the hacking.\nWhile Trump downplayed the impact of the hacks, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has said it compromised federal agencies as well as \u201ccritical infrastructure.\u201d Homeland Security, the agency\u2019s parent department, defines such infrastructure as any \u201cvital\u201d assets to the U.S. or its economy, a broad category that could include power plants and financial institutions.\nOne U.S. official, speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss a matter that is under investigation, described the hack as severe and extremely damaging.\n\u201cThis is looking like it\u2019s the worst hacking case in the history of America,\u201d the official said. \u201cThey got into everything.\u201d\nTrump had been silent on the hacks before Saturday.\nDeputy White House press secretary Brian Morgenstern on Friday declined to discuss the matter, but told reporters that national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien had sometimes been leading multiple daily meetings with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence agencies, looking for ways to mitigate the hack.\n\u201cRest assured we have the best and brightest working hard on it each and every single day,\u201d he said.\nThe Democratic leaders of four House committees given classified briefings by the administration on the hack have complained that they \u201cwere left with more questions than answers.\u201d\n\u201cAdministration officials were unwilling to share the full scope of the breach and identities of the victims,\u201d they said.\nPompeo, in the interview with Levin, said Russia was on the list of \u201cfolks that want to undermine our way of life, our republic, our basic democratic principles. ... You see the news of the day with respect to their efforts in the cyberspace. We\u2019ve seen this for an awfully long time, using asymmetric capabilities to try and put themselves in a place where they can impose costs on the United States.\u201d\nWhat makes this hacking campaign so extraordinary is its scale: 18,000 organizations were infected from March to June by malicious code that piggybacked on popular network-management software from an Austin, Texas, company called SolarWinds.\nIt\u2019s going to take months to kick elite hackers out of the U.S. government networks they have been quietly rifling through since as far back as March.\nExperts say there simply are not enough skilled threat-hunting teams to duly identify all the government and private-sector systems that may have been hacked. FireEye, the cybersecurity company that discovered the intrusion into U.S. agencies and was among the victims, has already tallied dozens of casualties.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Contradicting his secretary of state and other top officials, President Donald Trump on Saturday suggested without evidence that China \u2014 not Russia \u2014 may be behind the cyber espionage operation against the United States and tried to minimize its impact. In his first comments on the breach, Trump scoffed at the focus on the Kremlin and downplayed the intrusions, which the nation\u2019s cybersecurity agency has warned posed a \u201cgrave\u201d risk to government and private networks. \u201cThe Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality. I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control,\u201d Trump tweeted. He also claimed the media are \u201cpetrified\u201d of \u201cdiscussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!).\u201d There is no evidence to suggest that is the case. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said late Friday that Russia was \u201cpretty clearly\u201d behind the operation against the United States. \u201cThis was a very significant effort and I think it\u2019s the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,\u201d Pompeo said in the interview with radio talk show host Mark Levin. Officials at the White House had been prepared to put out a statement Friday afternoon that accused Russia of being \u201cthe main actor\u201d in the hack, but were told at the last minute to stand down, according to one U.S. official familiar with the conversations who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. It is not clear whether Pompeo got that message before his interview, but officials are now scrambling to figure out how to square the disparate accounts. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the statement or the basis of Trump\u2019s claims. The State Department also did not respond to questions about Pompeo\u2019s remarks. Throughout his presidency, Trump has refused to blame Russia for well-documented hostilities, including its interference in the 2016 election to help him get elected. He blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, has endorsed allowing Russia to return to the G-7 group of nations and has never taken the country to task for allegedly putting bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. Pompeo in the interview said the government was still \u201cunpacking\u201d the cyberespionage operation and some of it would likely remain classified. \u201cBut suffice it to say there was a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside of U.S. government systems and it now appears systems of private companies and companies and governments across the world as well,\u201d he said. Though Pompeo was the first Trump administration official to publicly blame Russia for the intrusion, cybersecurity experts and other U.S. officials have been clear over the past week that the operation appears to be the work of Russia. There has been no credible suggestion that any other country \u2014 including China \u2014 is responsible. Democrats in Congress who have received classified briefings have also affirmed publicly that Russia, which in 2014 hacked the State Department and interfered through hacking in the 2016 presidential election, was behind it. It\u2019s not clear exactly what the hackers were seeking, but experts say it could include nuclear secrets, blueprints for advanced weaponry, COVID-19 vaccine-related research and information for dossiers on government and industry leaders. ADVERTISEMENT Russia has said it had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with the hacking. While Trump downplayed the impact of the hacks, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has said it compromised federal agencies as well as \u201ccritical infrastructure.\u201d Homeland Security, the agency\u2019s parent department, defines such infrastructure as any \u201cvital\u201d assets to the U.S. or its economy, a broad category that could include power plants and financial institutions. One U.S. official, speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss a matter that is under investigation, described the hack as severe and extremely damaging. \u201cThis is looking like it\u2019s the worst hacking case in the history of America,\u201d the official said. \u201cThey got into everything.\u201d Trump had been silent on the hacks before Saturday. Deputy White House press secretary Brian Morgenstern on Friday declined to discuss the matter, but told reporters that national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien had sometimes been leading multiple daily meetings with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence agencies, looking for ways to mitigate the hack. \u201cRest assured we have the best and brightest working hard on it each and every single day,\u201d he said. The Democratic leaders of four House committees given classified briefings by the administration on the hack have complained that they \u201cwere left with more questions than answers.\u201d \u201cAdministration officials were unwilling to share the full scope of the breach and identities of the victims,\u201d they said. Pompeo, in the interview with Levin, said Russia was on the list of \u201cfolks that want to undermine our way of life, our republic, our basic democratic principles. ... You see the news of the day with respect to their efforts in the cyberspace. We\u2019ve seen this for an awfully long time, using asymmetric capabilities to try and put themselves in a place where they can impose costs on the United States.\u201d What makes this hacking campaign so extraordinary is its scale: 18,000 organizations were infected from March to June by malicious code that piggybacked on popular network-management software from an Austin, Texas, company called SolarWinds. ADVERTISEMENT It\u2019s going to take months to kick elite hackers out of the U.S. government networks they have been quietly rifling through since as far back as March. Experts say there simply are not enough skilled threat-hunting teams to duly identify all the government and private-sector systems that may have been hacked. FireEye, the cybersecurity company that discovered the intrusion into U.S. agencies and was among the victims, has already tallied dozens of casualties. It\u2019s racing to identify more. Many federal workers \u2014 and others in the private sector \u2014 must presume that unclassified networks are teeming with spies. Agencies will be more inclined to conduct sensitive government business on Signal, WhatsApp and other encrypted smartphone apps. If the hackers are indeed from Russia\u2019s SVR foreign intelligence agency, as experts believe, their resistance may be tenacious. The only way to be sure a network is clean is \u201cto burn it down to the ground and rebuild it,\u201d said Bruce Schneier, a prominent security expert and Harvard fellow. Florida became the first state to acknowledge falling victim to a SolarWinds hack. Officials told The Associated Press that hackers apparently infiltrated the state\u2019s health care administration agency and others. SolarWinds\u2019 customers include most Fortune 500 companies, and its U.S. government clients are rich with generals and spymasters. ___ Associated Press writers Frank Bajak in Boston, Eric Tucker in Washington and Bobby Caina Calvan in Tallahassee, Florida, contributed to this report.",

One Republican familiar with the situation said Saturday afternoon that the crossover was imminent. \u201cIn the works as we speak,\u201d the member said, noting that Van Drew had a meeting \u201cat length\u201d with Trump on Friday. The meeting between Trump and Van Drew was first reported by the Washington Post. Republicans on Capitol Hill had been whispering all week about whether Van Drew might join their ranks \u2014 some senior Republicans had even encouraged the move. Van Drew does not currently have any primary challengers \u2014 but Brigid Harrison, a professor at Montclair State University, had been publicly mulling a run, citing Van Drew's opposition to impeachment. He already has three GOP challengers, including businessman David Richter, who has the ability to self-fund and has already loaned his campaign $300,000. Van Drew, a dentist and former state senator whose district includes the southern portion of the state, was a long sought-after Democratic recruit. He rebuffed entreaties to run until Republican Rep. Frank LoBiondo decided to retire last cycle. Trump carried the district by 5 points in 2016. Van Drew won it by 8 points in 2018, beating Seth Grossman, an opponent whom national Republicans disavowed after discovering he had made racially insensitive comments. Local Democrats were enraged by the news. Atlantic County Democratic Chairman Michael Suleiman, whose county is entirely within the 2nd Congressional District, called Van Drew a \u201ccoward\u201d who \u201ctook the easy way out.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to vote against impeachment, but instead of owning up to his constituents and explaining to them why he\u2019s doing what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s now decided to just completely abandon the Democratic Party and switch,\u201d Suleiman said. \u201cIt\u2019s just unconscionable.\u201d Sarah Ferris, Matt Friedman and Andrew Desiderio contributed to this report.",
        "summarized_context": "Democratic Representative Jeff Van Drew, who has been strongly opposed to impeaching President Donald Trump, is reportedly planning to switch parties and become a Republican. Van Drew is one of two Democrats who voted against opening the impeachment inquiry into Trump and has remained against the effort. His decision comes after a meeting with Trump on Friday. Van Drew's staff and other members of the New Jersey delegation were informed of his plans to switch parties on Saturday. It is still unclear if Van Drew will make the announcement before the House votes on impeachment, which is expected next week. Republicans are excited about the news, seeing it as a blow to Democrats' impeachment efforts. However, Democrats are brushing off the party switch, saying it is purely based on politics and voters will see through his motivations. Van Drew's departure is unlikely to impact the impeachment vote tally, as Democratic leadership had already expected a handful of members to vote against impeachment. Van Drew's approval ratings are under water with Democratic voters in his district, and a recent poll showed that only 24% of Democratic primary voters believe he deserves to be reelected."
