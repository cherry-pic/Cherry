Task #4:
ARTICLE:
(Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday filed a new challenge to the Manhattan district attorney's subpoena for his tax returns, weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court said the president was not immune from state criminal probes. U.S. President Donald Trump wears a protective face mask during a tour of the Fujifilm diosynth biotechnologies' innovation center, a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant where components for a potential Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine candidate Novavax are being developed, in Morrrisville, North Carolina, U.S., July 27, 2020. Reuters/Carlos Barria. In a second amended complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Trump's lawyers argued that the subpoena was "wildly overbroad," and was issued in "bad faith" and amounts to "harassment." The subpoena "is so sweeping that it amounts to an unguided and unlawful 'fishing expedition' into the President's personal and financial dealings," Trump's lawyers wrote in the complaint. Trump, who is seeking re-election on Nov. 3, asked the court to declare the subpoena invalid. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance last August issued the grand jury subpoena to Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, demanding eight years of his business and personal returns and other documents as part of an investigation involving Trump and the Trump Organization, his family’s real estate business. On July 9, the Supreme Court in a 7-2 vote rejected his argument that he was immune from state criminal probes while in the White House. The high court said, however, that Trump could challenge the subpoena on other grounds. In the newly amended complaint, Trump's lawyers say Vance is demanding documents that relate to topics beyond New York jurisdiction, and argue the subpoena was issued in bad faith because it mirrors a congressional subpoena. Vance's investigation began after reports that Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen paid pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 for her silence before the 2016 election about sexual encounters with Trump, which he has denied. Carey Dunne, general counsel for Vance, on July 16 warned U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marrero against allowing Trump to delay long enough to get beyond statutes of limitations. Even if Vance prevails, grand jury secrecy rules make it unlikely Trump's financial records will become public soon. But that could change if charges are filed against other defendants.

STATEMENT:
Trump files new effort to block Manhattan Da Vance's subpoena for tax records.

Task #8:
ARTICLE:
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Bahrain and Oman could be the next Gulf countries to follow the United Arab Emirates in formalising ties with Israel, Israel's intelligence minister said on Sunday. Israel and the UAE announced on Thursday that they will normalise diplomatic relations, reshaping Middle East politics from the Palestinian issue to the fight against Iran. "In the wake of this agreement will come additional agreements, both with more Gulf countries and with Muslim countries in Africa," Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen told Army Radio. "I think that Bahrain and Oman are definitely on the agenda. In addition, in my assessment, there is a chance that already in the coming year there will be a peace deal with additional countries in Africa, chief among them, Sudan," he said. Both Bahrain and Oman praised the U.S.-sponsored accord, but neither have commented on their own prospects for normalised relations or responded to requests for comment on the subject. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met with Omani and Sudanese leaders in the past two years, including a visit to Oman in october 2018. “I expect more countries will be joining us in the peace circle, ” Netanyahu told Cabinet Ministers on Sunday, according to a statement from his office. “ This is a historic change which advances peace with the Arab world and will eventually advance a real, sober and secure peace with the Palestinians,” he said. The UAE-Israel deal firms up opposition to regional power iran. The Palestinians denounced the deal as a betrayal. UAE and Israeli foreign ministers held their first publicly-acknowledged call on Sunday after the gulf state opened telephone lines to Israel. Israel signed peace agreements with Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994. But the UAE, along with most other Arab nations, has had no formal diplomatic or economic relations with it. Oman maintains friendly ties with both the United States and Iran and has previously been a go-between for the two feuding countries. Slideshow ( 2 images ) a close ally of Saudi Arabia - which has not yet commented on the UAE-Israel accord - Bahrain hosted a senior Israeli official at a security conference in 2019 as well as a U.S-led conference on boosting the Palestinian economy as part U.S. president Donald Trump’ s Middle East peace initiative. Government sources in Kuwait said its position towards Israel is unchanged, and it will be the last country to normalise relations, local newspaper Al-Qabas reported.
