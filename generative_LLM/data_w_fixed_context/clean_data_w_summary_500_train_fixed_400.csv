The Biden team plans to share additional details on how they will release available doses next week.	0
2021_01_08_5	0	But TJ Ducklo, a Biden spokesman, said the president-elect plans to release added details next week.	President-elect Joe Biden plans to release almost all available doses of the COVID-19 vaccine when he takes office, in contrast to the Trump administration's strategy of holding back half of the vaccine production for second doses. Releasing all available doses could increase the availability of vaccines and potentially reduce the number of new cases. A group of governors has written a letter to the federal government urging the distribution of reserved doses to states. The Trump administration has defended its strategy of holding back doses to ensure second doses are available, but there is a debate about whether releasing all doses would be a better approach. The vaccines by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna require two doses for full effectiveness. The FDA has emphasized the importance of administering both doses at the specified intervals. A study suggests that reducing the amount of vaccine doses withheld and supplying a steady dose per week could help avoid more cases.

2020_09_25_4	0	No 'coordinated national voter fraud effort' in past elections, FBI director says	FBI Director Christopher Wray stated during a Senate panel that there has not been a coordinated national voter fraud effort in past elections, regardless of the method of voting. He acknowledged that there has been voter fraud at the local level, but emphasized that the FBI takes the responsibility to investigate such fraud seriously. Wray also confirmed that Russia has been actively trying to influence US elections, with the primary goal of denigrating Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

Wray clarified that Antifa is an ideology or movement rather than an organization, but acknowledged that there are investigations into violent anarchist extremists who identify with Antifa. He also stated that the majority of recent protests have been peaceful, but the FBI is investigating individuals involved in criminal activity.

2020_12_19_0	0	Congressional leaders are planning to attach the coronavirus relief to a massive spending package to keep the government funded through the rest of the fiscal year.	Congress has faced a new obstacle in approving a coronavirus aid deal, leading to a two-day funding extension to avert a government shutdown. The House passed the extension with a vote of 320-60, and the Senate quickly approved it. President Donald Trump signed the stopgap bill, setting a new deadline for Sunday midnight. The $900 billion framework that had been agreed upon earlier in the week included provisions for federal unemployment benefits, direct payments, small business funding, and vaccine distribution. However, Democrats accused Republicans, led by Sen. Pat Toomey, of trying to hinder the incoming Biden administration by cutting off Federal Reserve emergency lending facilities. Democrats want to extend this authority into the new year, while Toomey argues that the programs were meant to be temporary. The language sought by Toomey is seen as overly broad and restrictive by Democrats. Despite the setback, congressional leaders remain optimistic about reaching a bipartisan agreement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plan to combine the Covid-19 relief package with a $1.4 trillion funding bill. The main hurdle remains the Toomey language, which caused delays in the negotiations. Lawmakers are eager to finalize the deal, but the Fed lending authority remains a point of contention	1

Former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith is expected to plead guilty to falsifying a document used in the surveillance of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page. Clinesmith altered an email from the CIA that was used in the final application for a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant against Page. The alteration falsely claimed that Page was “not a source“ for the CIA, when in fact the CIA had informed the FBI that Page had been an operational contact for them. Clinesmith's plea is part of U.S. Attorney John Durham's investigation into the origins of the Russia probe. The plea does not allege any bias against President Trump or a broader effort to undermine his presidency.

2020_08_03_9	0	The Manhattan district attorney suggested that the office’s subpoena for President Donald Trump’s financial records is part of an investigation into “possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization“ that was alleged in media reports in recent years, according to a new court filing.	A new court filing suggests that the Manhattan District Attorney's investigation into President Donald Trump's finances extends beyond the “hush money“ payments made during the 2016 campaign. The investigation now includes allegations of bank and insurance fraud. The district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., emphasized the broad scope of the investigation as he fights to obtain eight years of financial records related to Trump and his business empire. Trump had previously filed a federal lawsuit to block the subpoena for these records, but the Supreme Court unanimously rejected his claim of absolute immunity. However, Trump's attorneys argue that the subpoena is overbroad. Vance's filing counters this argument by stating that the investigation is examining a wide array of matters related to the Trump Organization, including allegations of insurance and bank fraud. The filing also cites news articles alleging that Trump inflated the value of his assets when obtaining loans and diminished those values when paying taxes. The outcome of the litigation could have political implications, as Vance may be able to obtain indictments before the upcoming election if he can obtain the financial records in a timely manner. However, if the litigation drags on, Vance may not be able to take any significant steps before early November. The judge overseeing the case has expressed a desire to move the court fight	1

Vance Jr. told the court on Monday that publicly available information about the Trump organization and its officers, which includes allegations of insurance and bank fraud, provides a legal basis for requesting the substantial amount of financial records from the president’s accounting firm, Mazars USA.

2020_09_17_6	0	Democrat Joe Biden is narrowly ahead of President Donald Trump in the key swing state of Arizona, and Democrat Mark Kelly is leading GOP Sen. Martha McSally, according to a new poll from Monmouth University released Thursday.	Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is leading President Trump by 4 points in Arizona, according to a Monmouth University poll. Biden has 48 percent support, while Trump trails at 44 percent. This is within the poll's margin of error. Other recent polls have also shown Biden with an advantage in Arizona, a state that Trump won in 2016. One factor driving Biden's lead is his support among Latino voters, with the poll showing him leading Trump 63 percent to 33 percent. Biden also has a sizable lead in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix and its suburbs. A win for Biden in Arizona would significantly ease his path to 270 electoral votes. In the Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly holds a 6-point lead over Sen. Martha McSally (R).	1

The NDAA, which sets defense priorities and resources for the US military, has been passed every year for 59 years.

2020_09_13_3	0	Bloomberg to spend up to $100 million to beat Trump in Florida	Billionaire Mike Bloomberg has announced that he will spend up to $100 million in Florida to help defeat President Donald Trump in the upcoming election. This comes as polls show a tightening race between Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden in the state. Bloomberg's efforts will primarily focus on digital and TV ads, with a particular emphasis on reaching Hispanic voters. Vote-by-mail ballots will start being sent out in six days, and Florida also has an in-person early voting period that begins in October. Bloomberg's advisers hope that his investment will tip the state in favor of Biden and force Republicans to shift their resources to Florida. Both sides are already spending heavily on TV ads in the state, with a total of $319 million in ad time reserved. Bloomberg's decision to invest in Florida comes after news that Trump is considering spending his own money on his re-election campaign. Bloomberg, who ran against Biden in the Democratic primary, dropped out of the race in March after his record spending failed to yield significant wins. The money for Bloomberg's efforts will be funneled through his super PAC Independence USA and other Democratic organizations. The announcement comes after the Cook Political Report moved Florida from “Lean Democrat“ to “Toss Up“ status. Trump responded to the news on	1
